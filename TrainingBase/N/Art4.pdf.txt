3.1. Analyzing the factors affecting evolutionary rate variations between
housekeeping and tissue speciﬁc human interacting proteins

   We compiled a list of 1350 housekeeping and 1290 tissue speciﬁc
proteins present in human PPIN according to the method as described
in material and methods section. The number of non-synonymous
substitution per non-synonymous site (dn) was estimated for these
proteins using mouse orthologs. Pair-wise non-parametric Mann–
Whitney test between housekeeping and tissue speciﬁc proteins
present in human PPIN revealed that housekeeping interacting
proteins are evolutionarily slower (dn = 0.09) (P b 0.001) than tissue
speciﬁc proteins (dn = 0.11) which is in agreement with the previous                          Fig. 1. Distribution of interacting proteins in housekeeping and tissue speciﬁc genes
