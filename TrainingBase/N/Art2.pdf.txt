                 Abstract
                 Background: In contrast to the essentially fully assembled genome sequences of the kinetoplastid
                 pathogens Leishmania major and Trypanosoma brucei the assembly of the Trypanosoma cruzi genome
                 has been hindered by its repetitive nature and the fact that the reference strain (CL Brener) is a
                 hybrid of two distinct lineages. In this work, the majority of the contigs and scaffolds were
                 assembled into pairs of homologous chromosomes based on predicted parental haplotype,
                 inference from TriTryp synteny maps and the use of end sequences from T. cruzi BAC libraries.
                 Results: Ultimately, 41 pairs of chromosomes were assembled using this approach, a number in
                 agreement with the predicted number of T. cruzi chromosomes based upon pulse field gel analysis,
                 with over 90% (21133 of 23216) of the genes annotated in the genome represented. The approach
                 was substantiated through the use of Southern blot analysis to confirm the mapping of BAC clones
                 using as probes the genes they are predicted to contain, and each chromosome construction was
                 visually validated to ensure sufficient evidence was present to support the organization. While
                 many members of large gene families are incorporated into the chromosome assemblies, the
                 majority of genes excluded from the chromosomes belong to gene families, as these genes are
                 frequently impossible to accurately position.
                 Conclusion: Now assembled, these chromosomes bring T. cruzi to the same level of organization
                 as its kinetoplastid relatives and have been used as the basis for the T. cruzi genome in TriTrypDB,
                 a trypanosome database of EuPathDB. In addition, they will provide the foundation for analyses
                 such as reverse genetics, where the location of genes and their alleles and/or paralogues is
                 necessary and comparative genome hybridization analyses (CGH), where a chromosome-level view
                 of the genome is ideal.

Clone") are shown for the homologous chromosome pairs (the non-Esmeraldo-like haplotype are the "P" features and the
Esmeraldo-like haplotype are the "S" features) of chromosome TcChr39. Where possible, contigs are aligned to place at least
one pair of alleles in the same locus (red contigs). Lines between genes on the two homologous chromosomes indicate allelic
synteny. BAC clones are color-coded according to the source library (blue = TARBAC, green = EPIFOS); note that only BAC
clones that span scaffolds or whose ends map to opposite homologous chromosomes (light blue and light green) are shown.
Black contigs are those that were not aligned with another on the opposite chromosome (either no homologous sequence
present or the alignment could not be made). Finally, brown contigs indicate possible merged sequence from the two parental
haplotypes, blue contigs denote sequences where one or more alleles exist on this chromosome but could not be aligned, and
gray contigs indicate sequences where one or more alleles exist on a different chromosome altogether. b) The TriTryp synteny
map of TcChr39 shows the regions of T. brucei ("Tb Chromosome Portion") and L. major ("Lm Chromosome Portion") for
which at least 10 genes are syntenous with T. cruzi genes are shown. For each chromosome (i.e. Tc, Lm, Tb), the coding strand
is shown ("Rev" for reverse strand and "For" for forward strand). Telomeric repeats were identified on the 3' end of this chro-

Validation of assemblies by Southern "dot" blot analysis. a) The top-most cartoon depicts overlapping BAC clones
(light blue) which are predicted to span a chromosome (assembled from multiple scaffolds, dark blue). Genes (orange) are
selected such that they link proposed contiguous scaffolds. These overlapping pairs of probes create a stair-stepping effect on
the Southern blot if the hybridization results are as predicted (bottom), indicating that the linkage of the scaffolds, and thus the
chromosome, is correct. b) TcChr20 was chosen for Southern blot validation. Overlapping BAC clones (grey) are selected
such that they span most of the chromosome. Gene probes are shown in orange (ids shown are truncated forms of the "Tc"
gene ids, i.e. 506581.10 denotes Tc00.1047053506851.10). While there are 11 previously published scaffolds linked on this
chromosome, the red stars indicate a region containing many trans-sialidase genes whose repetitive nature must have hindered
the joining of the 4 scaffolds that terminate in this region (2 large "P" scaffolds and 2 "S" scaffolds). c) For each BAC clone, both
of the gene probes positively hybridize as predicted, creating the stair-step effect that confirms the linkage of the genes on the
chromosome. BAC clones are labeled with their assigned ids from the CHORI library.

Differentiation of alleles from paralogues. a) The solid boxes highlight assembly issues with the current genome. The
solid gray boxes (locus "A") show a helicase gene where 1 allele is fully sequenced on the P chromosome and the other is in 2
pieces on S. The solid brown boxes (locus "B") show a hypothetical protein with no fully sequenced copy: the 2 genes on the P
chromosome and 2 genes on the S chromosome both reside at contig boundaries and should be merged. Finally, the solid blue
boxes (locus "C") show a case of 2 copies (at least partially sequenced) on the P chromosome and 1 presumed fully sequenced

gene family members (non-blue "Gene Features"), while on either side of the region are "core" regions with either hypothetical
genes or those with an assigned putative function (light and dark blue "Gene Features"). The large number of spanning BAC

noted that these homologous chromosomes are likely different sizes. The BAC clones on the "S" chromosome that span the

Local inversion on T. cruzi TcChr11. a) The region on left-hand side of homologous chromosome P appears inverted rela-
tive to S, as the orientation of scaffold CH473345-1 was reversed relative to CH473447 in order to close the BAC clones on
both homologous chromosomes (i.e if CH473345-1 was oriented according to allelic synteny, then the BAC clones on the P
chromosome would be unclosed). b) BAC clones and probes were chosen for Southern blot analysis to validate this inversion.
The left-hand side shows a diagram of the design of the blot (see Figure 4 for more details). The chromosome inversion is con-
firmed if BAC clones 15L22, 14F9, 3J3, and 5D6 contains genes G1–G7 (but not G8), but BAC clones 17N21, 8P12, 6L16, and
10F10 contain genes G1–G3 and G5–G8 (but not G4). The right-hand side of the figure shows the result of the analysis where
the hybridization results confirm the inversion.
