Schematic outline of a 2-D DIGE experiment with an internal pooled standard and three fluorescent dyes. Samples A and B are labelled with
either Cy3 or Cy5, but a pooled internal standard is also constructed from equal amounts of all the samples in the experiment and labelled with
Cy2. After mixing these protein samples and performing 2-DGE, the respective protein spot patterns can again be visualized by illuminating the gel
with the specific excitation wavelengths. The sample A and B protein spot intensities can now be normalized by dividing each spot intensity by the
corresponding spot intensity of the pooled internal standard. Analyzing these normalized spot intensities enables the detection of more subtle
differences in protein expression levels with a higher statistical confidence.
