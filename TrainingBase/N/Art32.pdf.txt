       proteins with highly designable structures (structures that are encoded by many sequences) will evolve more rapidly.
       Recent theoretical advances argue that structures with a higher density of interresidue contacts are more designable,
       and we show that high contact density is correlated with an increased rate of sequence evolution in yeast. In addition,
       we investigate the correlations between the rate of sequence evolution and several other structural descriptors, carefully
       controlling for the strong effect of expression level on evolutionary rate. Overall, we find that the structural descriptors that
       we consider appear to explain roughly 10% of the variation in rates of protein evolution in yeast. We also show that despite
       the well-known trend for buried residues to be more conserved, proteins with a higher fraction of buried residues, nonethe-
       less, tend to evolve their sequences more rapidly. We suggest that this effect is due to the increased designability of struc-
       tures with more buried residues. Our results provide evidence that protein structure plays an important role in shaping the
       rate of sequence evolution and provide evidence to support recent theoretical advances linking structural designability to
       contact density.

                  make a statistically significant contribution to the variation in dN are shown in boldface (P , 0.05 for all components in boldface).
