    Measurement of the physical and chemical properties of a puri-
 fied protein requires a method for determination of the protein
concentrations of the solutions employed. Spectrophotometric meas-
 urements are widely used as a convenient, sensitive, and precise
method for the determination of protein concentration. However,
spectrophotometric measurements require a knowledge of an ex-
tinction coefficient for each protein, since the relative number of
chromophoric amino acid residues varies from protein to protein.
 Determination of an extinction coefficient requires an independent
and precise method of measuring protein concentration. The limited
supply of many purified enzymes precludes the use of dry weight
measurements in determining the extinction coefficient. Although
chemical methods for protein determination, such as the Kjeldahl,
Folin-Ciocalteu, or biuret procedures, require much less protein,
such measurements must be related to a standard reference protein.
Since each of these chemical methods is sensitive to the relative
abundance of specific amino acid residues in proteins (l-3)) an
arbitrary standard protein such as bovine serum albumin may be
inappropriate for a given protein of unknown composition.
    Although the molar refractions of the amino acid residues also
exhibit considerable variation (4)) the refractive indices of proteins
vary by less than 62% (4,5). Accordingly, refractometric measure-
ments can be used to determine protein concentration. This com-
munication describes the use of an analytical ultracentrifuge as a
differential refractometer to determine the concentration of small
volumes of dilute protein solutions.

                         MATERIALS          AND       METHODS

    Proteins.      Ribonuclease     A, trypsin, chymotrypsin,           and lactate de-
hydrogenase were purchased from Worthington                       Biochemical      Corp.,
serum albumin           and cytochrome           c from Sigma Chemical Co., and
aldolase from Boehringer             und Soehne. Ovalbumin          and methemoglo-
bin were gifts from Dr. H. B. Bull. All proteins except trypsin were
dialyzed against 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Trypsin                             was
dialyzed against 0.05 M tris-HCl                 buffer, pH 8.0. All solutions were
clarified by centrifugation           to remove any insoluble material.
     Ultracentrifugal       menswrements.          A 0.15 ml aliquot of a protein
solution was placed in one limb of a 12 mm double-sector synthetic
boundary centerpiece assembled in a cell together with sapphire
windows, and 0.42 ml of the outer dialysis solution in the other limb
of the centerpiece. All centrifugation                  was performed       in a Spinco
model E analytical          ultracentrifuge        at 20’ using a Wratten No. 77A
filter, Solvent was layered over the solution by accelerating                    a rotor
containing        the cell to a speed of less than 10,000 rpm to form the
solvent-protein         boundary.       The rotor was then maintained             at this
speed to permit the boundary to diffuse. When individual                         fringes
could be discerned across the boundary in the viewing screen, a
photograph          of the cell contents was taken using Kodak spectro-
scopic II-G photographic              plates. The rotor was then stopped, un-
coupled from the centrifuge,               inverted several times to destroy any
protein gradients, reaccelerated to the operating speed, and photo-
graphed to provide a baseline exposure to correct for any optical
distortion       of the interference         fringes. The number of interference
fringes traversed when crossing the protein-solvent                      boundary was
measured with the aid of a Nikon microcomparator.
     Spect~ophotometric          measurements.         The absorbance of aliquots of
all solutions was measured at 280 rnp except those of cytochrome c
and methemoglobin,             which were measured at 550 and 500 rnp, re-
spectively. A Gilford spectrophotometer                   was used. Protein concen-
trations were calculated using the extinction                   coefficients shown in
 Table 1.
                          RESULTS         AND       DISCUSSION
    The number of interference       fringes observed for each protein
exhibited a linear dependence on protein concentration        in the range
0.1 to 5.0 mg/ml.      A typical example is shown in Figure 1. Protein
concentrations     less than 0.1 mg/ml produced interference       patterns
exhibiting    curvature throughout     the cell, suggesting that the small
difference in the densities of the solution and solvent at these low

protein concentrations        cause convective stirring during the layering
of solvent. The refractive          increment     in fringes/mg/ml           calculated
from the slope of the observed linear relationship                 for each protein
is shown in Table 1. The seven nonheme proteins have an average
refractive     increment     of 4.10 f 0.13 interference             fringes/mg/ml,
while the two hemoproteins            have an average value of 4.47 I+ 0.04
fringes/mg/ml.
     The refractive     index of each of the seven nonheme proteins was
calculated from their amino acid compositions,                 partial specific vol-
umes, and refraction         per gram residue (4) using the Lorentz and
Lorenz equation as described by McMeekin                  et al. (4). As shown in
Figure 2, the observed refractive             increment      exhibits a linear de-
pendence on the calculated refractive               indices, indicating        that the
variation    in refractive increment        is due to the differences in amino
acid composition        and not to procedural         errors. Assuming         that the
seven nonheme proteins examined represent a normal variation                           of
amino acid composition,          measurement         of the concentration          of an
unknown unconjugated           protein should not be in error by more than
-3% using an ultracentrifuge              as a differential     refractometer        and
the reported refractive increment.            This procedure can be employed
to determine        the concentration      of protein solutions containing              as
little as 0.02 mg of protein in a volume of 0.15 ml.

   FIG. 1. Dependence of number of interference     fringes on protein concentra-
tion. A solution of lactic dehydrogenase was dialyzed against 0.05 1M phosphate
buffer, pH 7.0. Dilutions of the dialyzed protein solution were made with the
outer dialysis solution. Protein concentrations   were determined     spectrophoto-
metrically  using the extinction coefficient shown in Table 1.

     Prosthetic    groups would be expected to contribute        to the refrac-
tive increment        in accordance with their molar refraction       and frac-
tional concentration.          As shown in Table 1 and Figure            2, the
refractive      increments      of the hemoproteins,      cytochrome      c and
methemoglobin,         are substantially  greater than predicted from their
amino acid compositions.           Since these proteins contain only 4-60/o
heme by weight, the refraction per gram of heme must be markedly
different from that of an average amino acid residue. Therefore, to
utilize this method for the measurement              of the concentration     of
conjugated proteins, it will be necessary to evaluate the fractional
weight concentration          of the conjugated   moiety and its refraction
per gram.
