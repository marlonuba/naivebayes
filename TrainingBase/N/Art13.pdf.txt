Abstract
   The African trypanosomes remain well recognised for their role as an interesting model eukaryote for basic science, but are loosing ground
in their ability to contribute to understanding common cellular mechanisms. At the same time, the diseases they cause remain as prevalent as
ever, but appear increasingly irrelevant in their wider medical, social, economic and political context. What can be done to keep trypanosome
