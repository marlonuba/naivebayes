        Growing crystals
        from protein
        Beat Blattmann and Patrick Sticher from
        the University of Zürich, Switzerland,
        explain the science behind protein
        crystallography and provide a protocol
        for growing your own crystals from
        protein – an essential method used by
        scientists to determine protein structures.

           tape to prevent evaporation from the vessel (‘c’ in fig-
           ure on page 33).
        6. Store the plate at 20 °C. The crystals will start to grow
           immediately in some wells, and growth can be
           observed directly under the microscope at 1-2 hour
           intervals. The plates may be stored until the next lesson
           for final analysis. After about 1-2 weeks, crystals will
           have grown to their final size. A sealed plate will keep
           up to a year, sometimes even longer.
        7. Analyse the size, number and distribution of lysozyme
           crystals. The crystals may be too small to be observed
           with the naked eye, so a good magnifying glass or –
           even better – a microscope would be very useful.
