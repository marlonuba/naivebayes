Rosuvastatin, a new statin, has been shown to possess a number of advantageous phar-macological properties, including enhanced HMG-CoA reductase binding characteristics,relative hydrophilicity, and selective uptake into/activity in hepatic cells. CytochromeP450 (CYP) metabolism of rosuvastatin appears to be minimal and is principally mediatedby the 2C9 enzyme, with little involvement of 3A4; this finding is consistent with theabsence of clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between rosuva-statin and other drugs known to inhibit CYP enzymes. Dose-ranging studies in hypercho-lesterolemic patients demonstrated dose-dependent effects in reducing low-density lipo-protein cholesterol (LDL-C) (up to 63%), total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) Bacross a 1- to 40-mg dose range and a significant 8.4% additional reduction in LDL-C,compared with atorvastatin, across the dose ranges of the two agents. Rosuvastatin hasalso been shown to be highly effective in reducing LDL-C, increasing high-density lipo-protein cholesterol (HDL-C), and producing favorable modifications of other elements ofthe atherogenic lipid profile in a wide range of dyslipidemic patients. In patients with mildto moderate hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin has been shown to produce large de-creases in LDL-C at starting doses, thus reducing the need for subsequent dose titration,and to allow greater percentages of patients to attain lipid goals, compared with availablestatins. The substantial LDL-C reductions and improvements in other lipid measures withrosuvastatin treatment should facilitate achievement of lipid goals and reduce the re-quirement for combination therapy in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. In addi-tion, rosuvastatin’s effects in reducing triglycerides, triglyceride-containing lipoproteins,non–HDL-C, and LDL-C and increasing HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidemia orelevated triglycerides should be of considerable value in enabling achievement of LDL-C and non–HDL-C goals in the numerous patients with combined dyslipidemias or meta-bolic syndrome who require lipid-lowering therapy. Rosuvastatin is well tolerated alone,and in combination with fenofibrate, extended-release niacin, and cholestyramine, and hasa safety profile similar to that of currently marketed statins. A large, long-term clinicaltrials program is under way to investigate the effects of rosuvastatin on atherosclerosis andcardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the primary atherogenic lipoprotein. A wealth of ex-perimental, epidemiological, and clinical data indicate that elevated LDL cholesterol(LDL-C) or total cholesterol, as a surrogate for LDL-C, is associated with increased riskof atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) and that reduction of LDL-C is asso-ciated with reduced CHD morbidity and mortality (21). Statin drugs reduce cholesterolbiosynthesis by inhibiting the activity of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme in convertingHMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Statinsare the major pharmacological treatment for a number of dyslipidemias, primarily on thebasis of their ability to effectively reduce LDL-C. A number of large clinical trials haveunequivocally demonstrated the ability of statin therapy to reduce CHD events in indi-viduals with or without established CHD across a wide range of initial LDL-C levels(17,33,43,52,53,56).The observation that the relationship between LDL-C level and CHD risk is continuousfrom low to high LDL-C values and the relative failure to achieve guideline-recom-mended LDL-C levels in clinical practice (20,51,63) have prompted attempts to developstatins with improved pharmacology profiles, with the objective of greater efficacy in re-ducing LDL-C. Rosuvastatin (AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK;licensed from Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) is a new statin with pharmacologicaland clinical features that distinguish it from other currently available statins. This agenthas been shown to be highly effective in lowering LDL-C and improving other elementsof the atherogenic lipid profile in patients with a variety of dyslipidemias. Rosuvastatin (rosuvastatin calcium) is a synthetic compound that consists of a singleenantiomer formulated and administered as the calcium salt of the active hydroxy acid; itschemical name is bis{(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)ami-no]pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S )-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid} calcium salt. The empiricalformula for rosuvastatin calcium is (C22H27FN3O6S)2Ca. Its molecular weight is 1001.14.The structural formula is shown in Fig. 1. Rosuvastatin calcium is a white amorphouspowder that is sparingly soluble in water and methanol and slightly soluble in ethanol. HMG-CoA REDUCTASE BINDING AND INHIBITIONIn chemical structure rosuvastatin shows similarity to other compounds of the statinclass but also important differences. Rosuvastatin and other statins contain a dihydroxy heptenoic (heptanoic in some cases) acid chain that mimics the HMG portion of theHMG-CoA substrate. However, the additional ring structures and substituents of rosuva-statin differ from those of other statins. Of particular note is the polar methane sulfon-amide group that confers to the molecule a relatively low lipophilicity.The additional components of the molecule are also important in enzyme binding, andsubtle differences in the way different statins interact with the enzyme have been revealedby x-ray crystallography of the statin-enzyme complexes (28). In addition to a number ofinteractions with the active site that are common among the statins, rosuvastatin exhibitsa hydrogen bond between a sulfone oxygen atom and the enzyme Ser565, a binding traitotherwise observed only with atorvastatin (involving its carbonyl oxygen atom), and aunique polar interaction between the rosuvastatin electronegative sulfone group and theenzyme Arg568side chain. Consistent with these findings, rosuvastatin was found to be a relatively potent in-hibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, as measured in experiments using a cloned catalyticfragment of human HMG-CoA reductase. As with other statins, inhibition was compet-itive for HMG-CoA reductase and noncompetitive with NADPH. The inhibition constant(Ki) was approximately 0.1 nM. In the presence of a fixed concentration of HMG-CoAreductase, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were 5.4 nM for rosuvastatin, com-pared with 8.2 nM for atorvastatin, 10.0 nM for cerivastatin, 11.2 nM for simvastatin,27.6 nM for fluvastatin, and 44.1 nM for pravastatin (24,41). Thus, rosuvastatin is a rela-tively potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, consistent with some differences in theway the molecule binds the active site of the enzyme in comparison with other statins.CELL AND TISSUE SELECTIVITYAssessment of relative lipophilicity of statins showed that the statin octanol-water coef-ficients were –0.84 log D at pH 7.4 for pravastatin and –0.33 log D for rosuvastatin, compared with values of >1.0 to <2.0 for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin (sodium salt),and cerivastatin, indicating greater lipophilicity on the part of these latter drugs (11,41).Consistent with its hydrophilic properties, rosuvastatin was found to be highly selectivefor effect in hepatocytes, compared with a range of non-hepatic cells. Thus, when incu-bated with freshly prepared rat hepatocytes, rosuvastatin inhibited cholesterol synthesis inthese cells with an IC50 of 0.2 nM (95% confidence limits, 0.1–0.3 nM), and was found tobe significantly (P < 0.001) more potent than the other statins (IC50 range, 1.2–6.9 nM)(8). Studies assessing inhibitory effects in hepatic and non-hepatic cells showed that rosu-vastatin had an approximately 1,000-fold reduced potency in rat fibroblasts, comparedwith primary hepatocytes. The log10 ratio for IC50 values in hepatocytes:fibroblasts was3.3 for rosuvastatin and pravastatin, the other relatively hydrophilic compound, comparedwith 2.2 for atorvastatin, 0.54 for simvastatin, –0.04 for fluvastatin, and –0.14 for ceriva-statin (8,11). Thus, the marked hepatic cell selectivity of both rosuvastatin and pravastatinis in contrast with that of the more lipophilic compounds.Studies with 14C-labeled rosuvastatin in rat hepatocytes showed uptake by both non-specific diffusion and active transport, with a specific uptake Km of 9.2 ìM; comparisonwith pravastatin showed that the rate of active uptake clearance (Vmax/Km) for rosuvastatinwas greater and that rosuvastatin competitively inhibited pravastatin uptake with a Kivalue close to the Km for uptake (11,44).Additional studies indicate high affinity of rosuvastatin for liver-specific organic aniontransport proteins (OATPs), which may mediate efficient uptake into hepatocytes (4).Measurement of uptake of 3H-labeled rosuvastatin in oocytes expressing OATP-A, whichis expressed in the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and widely expressed in othertissues, and in those expressing the predominantly liver-specific OATP-C showed thatuptake was 20-fold greater in oocytes expressing OATP-C than in those expressingOATP-A or in H2O-injected control oocytes. The apparent Km for interaction between ro-suvastatin and OATP-C was 7.3 ìM; cis-inhibition studies of 3H-labeled rosuvastatinuptake indicated that the affinity of rosuvastatin for OATP-C was greater than that for pra-vastatin (30.3 ìM) and simvastatin (43.1 ìM), but not significantly different from that forthe lipophilic statin atorvastatin (2.5 ìM).After intravenous administration of14C-labeled rosuvastatin, 5 mg/kg, to rats, uptakeclearance rates as determined from plasma and tissue radioactivity levels were approxi-mately 0.9 mL/min/g into the liver, approximately 0.2 mL/min/g into the kidney, and<0.02 mL/min/g into other tissues (Fig. 2). Pravastatin also exhibited liver uptake selec-tivity, whereas simvastatin exhibited high uptake into liver and such other tissues as theadrenals and spleen (11). In summary, effective and selective delivery of rosuvastatin tothe liver is suggested by the combination of the compound’s relative hydrophilicity and itsselectivity for hepatic cells. NHIBITION OF HEPATIC CHOLESTEROL SYNTHESISIN ANIMAL MODELSRosuvastatin was found to be a potent inhibitor of hepatic cholesterol synthesis afteroral administration to the rat with a maximal effect at 1 h after administration. The 50% effective dose (ED50) measured 2 to 3 h after administration was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.4–1.5)mg/kg. Compared with other statins, rosuvastatin had a longer duration of action on rathepatic cholesterol synthesis. In the dog, plasma mevalonate levels were significantly re-duced at 1 to 6 h after single oral administration of the drug at 0.1 mg/kg and higherdoses; the ED50of rosuvastatin at 4 h after administration was approximately 0.2 mg/kg(41). Thus, in animal models, rosuvastatin was found to be a potent inhibitor of hepaticcholesterol synthesis. Consistent with inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis and lowering of plasma me-valonate levels, administration of rosuvastatin to dogs once daily in capsules for 14 daysat a dose level of 3 mg/kg reduced plasma cholesterol by 26%, and during administrationfor periods of up to 3 months, doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg were significantly effective(data on file, AstraZeneca). Rosuvastatin also lowered plasma cholesterol and atherogeniclipoproteins in cynomolgus monkeys and in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL)rabbits. In the latter animals, rosuvastatin at doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg administered for 6months lowered cholesterol levels by 29 and 32%, respectively, and this was accompanied by reductions in the surface coverage of the aortic arch by atherosclerotic lesions of 29and 24%, respectively (data on file, AstraZeneca).In addition to its lipid-lowering and antiatherosclerotic properties, rosuvastatin hasbeen found to exert a number of potentially beneficial effects in animal models that are notobviously the result of lipid lowering. Administration of rosuvastatin has been shown toresult in anti-inflammatory action in the microvascular endothelium (59), upregulate en-dothelial nitric oxide synthase, and protect against tissue damage in models of cerebraland cardiac ischemia (30,32), and increase the numbers of circulating endothelial progeni-tor cells and accelerate vascular reendothelialization (65). The clinical relevance of theseinteresting observations in animal models has yet to be evaluated. Rosuvastatin is administered orally, once daily. No clinically relevant differences inpharmacokinetics are observed between older and younger patients, between male andfemale patients, or between morning and evening dosing. The drug undergoes minimalmetabolism in vivo. No clinically significant interactions with known inhibitors of cyto-chrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 or other isoenzymes have been observed in drug interactionstudies.Rosuvastatin is administered orally in the active form. Peak plasma concentrations ofthe parent compound are reached at 3 to 5 h after oral dosing. Both peak plasma concen-tration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase in pro-portion to dose (61). In this study, after 7 days of administration of 40 mg rosuvastatinonce daily for 7 days, the geometric mean Cmaxand AUC values were 37.0 (38.1) ng/mLand 255.9 (24.6) (ng ? h)/mL, respectively (% coefficient of variation in parentheses). Theabsolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%. The mean volume of distri-bution at steady state is approximately 134 L. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma pro-teins, primarily albumin; binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations.The elimination half-life (t1/2) is approximately 19 h. The relatively long t1/2comparedwith some other statins may possibly reflect a degree of enterohepatic recirculation, a phe-nomenon that has been documented for rosuvastatin in the rat (data on file, AstraZeneca). Pharmacokinetic studies in subjects receiving rosuvastatin, 40 mg, showed no clini-cally relevant differences between its effects in younger (18 to 35 years) and older (>65years) subjects. Cmaxwas increased by 12% in younger subjects and AUC was increasedby 6% in younger subjects. There were also no significant differences in the effect of thedrug in males and females on these parameters (Cmaxreduced by 18% and AUC by 9% inmales) (36). Study of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rosuvastatin,10 mg, administered at 7:00 a.m. or at 6:00 p.m. showed no differences in Cmax(4.6 and4.5 ng/mL) or AUC [40.1 and 42.7 (ng ? h)/mL]. There was also no difference in urinaryexcretion of mevalonic acid or AUC for plasma mevalonic acid and no difference inLDL-C reduction (41 and 44%) after morning, as compared with evening dosing (39).These findings suggest that, unlike the case with several members of the statin class, thepharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rosuvastatin do not appear to be affected bytime of administration. Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized, with approximately 10% of an oral dosebeing recovered as metabolite. In studies with14C-labeled rosuvastatin, 90% of an oraldose was recovered in feces and 10% in urine (37). In feces, 92% of radioactivity was theparent compound, with N-desmethyl and 5S-lactone metabolites accounting for 6 and 2%,respectively. In urine, the parent compound accounted for approximately 50% of radioac-tivity, with N-desmethyl and 5S-lactone metabolites accounting for 20 and 10%, respec-tively. Overall, 85–95% of active plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is ac-counted for by the parent compound.Unlike most marketed statins, rosuvastatin exhibits minimal interaction with CYP iso-enzymes and undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism. Study of the effect of rosuvastatin50 ìM on CYP isoenzyme 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 activity in human hepaticmicrosomes showed no significant inhibitory effect on any enzymes; the most potent inhi-bition was for CYP 2C9, for which a 10% decrease in activity was observed (40). Investi-gation of the metabolism of14C-labeled rosuvastatin 1 to 4 ìM showed no metabolism inhuman hepatic microsomes (3-h incubation) or heterologously expressed human CYP en-zymes (1-h incubation), with very slow metabolism (5–50% over 3 d) being observed incultured human hepatocytes. In the latter case, a single N-desmethyl metabolite wasformed; inhibition of this metabolism by sulfaphenazole indicated that CYP 2C9 was theprimary enzyme involved, with less inhibition by omeprazole indicating a lesser role ofthe 2C19 enzyme. The N-desmethyl metabolite exhibits one sixth to one half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibition of the parent compound. Overall, these findings suggest thatrosuvastatin is unlikely to cause clinically significant metabolically mediated druginteractions. The absence of clinically significant interactions of rosuvastatin with inhibitors of CYPenzymes has been confirmed by drug interaction studies. Coadministration of rosuva-statin, 80 mg, and ketoconazole (CYP 3A4 inhibitor), 200 mg, resulted in virtually noeffect on rosuvastatin Cmax(4.6% decrease) or AUC (1.6% increase) (13). Itraconazole(CYP 3A4 inhibitor), 200 mg, increased Cmaxof rosuvastatin by 36 and 15%, and AUC by39 and 28%, at 10- and 80-mg doses, respectively (35). These changes are thought to bedue not to interaction with CYP enzymes but rather to the effect of an as-yet undefinedtransporter. Coadministration of rosuvastatin 80 mg with 500 mg of erythromycin (CYP3A4 inhibitor) reduced rosuvastatin Cmaxby 31% and AUC by 20% (14); this effect islikely due to increased gastrointestinal motility induced by erythromycin. Coadministra-tion of rosuvastatin 80 mg with 200 mg of fluconazole (a potent CYP 2C9 inhibitor) in-creased rosuvastatin Cmaxby 9% and AUC by 14% (12); this small effect supports limitedmetabolism of rosuvastatin via the 2C9 enzyme.In other drug-interaction studies, coadministration of rosuvastatin 10 mg and feno-fibrate 67 mg three times daily increased rosuvastatin Cmaxby 7% and AUC by 21% anddecreased fenofibric acid Cmaxby 9% and AUC by 4%. No clinically significant change indigoxin Cmax(4% increase) or AUC (4% increase) was observed with digoxin 0.5 mg androsuvastatin 40 mg (38).In studies in patients with hepatic insufficiency, rosuvastatin Cmaxand AUC were mod-estly increased in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, compared with con-trols (63.7 vs. 60.7 for AUC, 9.3 vs. 6.0 for Cmax). Patients with the highest scores (8 and9) in the Child-Pugh B category, however, had the highest Cmaxand AUC values (73.3 forAUC, 12.8 for Cmax), indicating that rosuvastatin exposure increased with greater hepatic impairment. A trend toward reduced LDL-C–lowering effectiveness was observed withgreater hepatic impairment (58). Rosuvastatin has been extensively evaluated in clinical trials in adult patients with mildto moderate hypercholesterolemia and mixed hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson’s type IIa /IIb),severe hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygousfamilial hypercholesterolemia), or hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson’s type IIb or IV),and in combination with other lipid-modifying agents in dyslipidemic patients. A con-sistent feature of the randomized, controlled trials is that patients underwent a 6-w dietarylead-in phase with discontinuation of all cholesterol-lowering drugs or supplements; pa-tients were instructed in the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) step I diet,and compliance with diet (Eating Pattern Assessment Tool score <28) was a requirementfor entry into the study treatment phase. Rosuvastatin has been assessed in dose-ranging studies and comparative trials withother statins in patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (type IIa/IIb).Dose-ranging studiesDose-ranging studies with rosuvastatin have demonstrated marked dose-related reduc-tions in LDL-C of up to 63% at 40 mg (46). A comparative dose-ranging study with ator-vastatin, which has been considered the most effective LDL-C–lowering statin (1,29),showed that rosuvastatin produces a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C across thedose range.In a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging program, 206 patients with LDL-C>160 and <220 mg/dL (>4.14 and <5.69 mmol/L) and triglycerides <300 mg/dL (<3.39mmol/L) received double-blind placebo or rosuvastatin 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg oropen-label atorvastatin (used as a benchmark, with no statistical comparisons performed)for 6 w (46). An intent-to-treat analysis of those patients receiving placebo or rosuvastatin,10, 20, or 40 mg, showed that rosuvastatin produced marked, dose-related reductions inLDL-C, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B from baseline, compared with place-bo (Table 1) (data on file, AstraZeneca). Increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), reductions in triglycerides, and reductions in lipid ratios were also observed forall three doses. In a randomized, double-blind trial (31), 374 patients with LDL-C ?160 and <250mg/dL (?4.14 and <6.46 mmol/L) and triglycerides <400 mg/dL (<4.52 mmol/L) re-ceived rosuvastatin 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg or atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 w.The primary analysis was change in LDL-C across the dose range of the two study drugsassessed by linear regression analysis. The LDL-C–lowering response with rosuvastatinwas significantly greater (P < 0.001) than that with atorvastatin by 8.4% across the doserange (Table 2). At doses of 10–80 mg, reductions in LDL-C were 47 to 62% with rosuvastatin and 38 to 53.5% with atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin also produced significantlygreater reductions than atorvastatin across the dose range (P < 0.001) in total cholesterol(4.9%), non–HDL-C (7.0%), apo B (6.3%), and LDL-C:HDL-C (9.5%), total choleste-rol:HDL-C (6.9%), non–HDL-C:HDL-C (8.4%), and apo B:apo A-I (7.8%). Rosuvastatin was compared with atorvastatin or with simvastatin and pravastatin in tri-als assessing initial doses and dose titration in patients with LDL-C ?160 and <250 mg/dL(?4.14 and <6.46 mmol/L) and triglycerides ?400 mg/dL (?4.52 mmol/L) (data on file,AstraZeneca). These trials were prospectively designed to allow pooling of data from12-w fixed-dose treatment phases (see pooled data analyses below). Together with resultsfrom the comparative dose-ranging study, the comparative trials vs. atorvastatin demon-strate that rosuvastatin significantly reduces LDL-C and significantly increases HDL-C,compared with atorvastatin at the usual starting dose, and enables more patients to achieveguideline LDL-C goals with reduced need for dose titration. Similarly, comparative trialswith simvastatin and pravastatin show that rosuvastatin markedly improves lipid mea-sures, compared with starting doses of these agents, and enables more patients to reachLDL-C goals.In a placebo-controlled trial (16), 516 patients received placebo, rosuvastatin 5 mg or10 mg, or atorvastatin 10 mg for 12 weeks. LDL-C reduction was significantly greaterwith both rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10 mg (40 and 43% vs. 35%,P < 0.01 and <0.001), and the increase in HDL cholesterol was significantly greater withboth rosuvastatin doses (13 and 12% vs. 8%, P < 0.01 and <0.05) (Table 3; placebo groupresults are not shown). Reductions in total cholesterol, apo B, and lipid ratios and in-creases in apo A-I were also significantly greater with both rosuvastatin doses, comparedwith atorvastatin, and reductions in triglycerides were similar in all active treatmentgroups. In a 52-w dose-titration trial (45,47,48), 412 patients received rosuvastatin 5 or 10 mgor atorvastatin 10 mg for 12 w, after which doses were sequentially doubled at 8-w in-tervals to a maximum of 80 mg if patients failed to reach NCEP Adult Treatment Panel II(ATP-II) LDL-C goal levels (22). After 12 w at starting doses, both rosuvastatin 5 mg and10 mg lowered LDL-C by a significantly higher percentage than atorvastatin 10 mg (46and 50% vs. 39%, both P < 0.001); both rosuvastatin doses also significantly lowered totalcholesterol, apo B, and non–HDL-C, compared with atorvastatin at 12 w (Table 4). At52 w, mean doses in the initial rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg groups were 9.3 and 13.4 mg, re-spectively, and the mean dose in the atorvastatin group was 20.8 mg. ATP-II LDL-C goalswere reached in 98% of the rosuvastatin 10 mg group, 88% of the rosuvastatin 5 mggroup, and 87% of the atorvastatin group, including 97, 65, and 61%, respectively, of pa-tients with the aggressive goal of ?100 mg/dL (?2.59 mmol/L). Overall, dose titrationwas performed in 18% of the rosuvastatin 10 mg group, 31% of the rosuvastatin 5 mggroup, and 41% of the atorvastatin group; only 2.5, 2, and 5% of the respective treatmentgroups required titration to 80 mg to achieve goal (67). At 52 w, reductions in LDL-Cwere significantly greater in both the rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg groups than in theatorvastatin group (47 and 53% vs. 44%, P < 0.05 and <0.001), and a significantly greaterreduction in total cholesterol and increase in HDL-C were observed in the rosuvastatin10 mg group, compared with the atorvastatin group. In a 12-w trial (49), 502 patients received rosuvastatin 5 or 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg,or pravastatin 20 mg for 12 weeks. Reductions in LDL-C with both rosuvastatin 5 and10 mg (42 and 49%) were significantly greater than with simvastatin (37%, P < 0.01 vs.rosuvastatin 5 mg and <0.001 vs. 10 mg) and pravastatin (28%, P < 0.001 for both)(Table 5). Both rosuvastatin doses also significantly lowered total cholesterol, apo B, andlipid ratios, compared with both simvastatin and pravastatin. In a 52-w dose-titration trial(5–7), 477 patients received rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin at the same startingdoses as in the 12-w trial, after which doses could be sequentially doubled at 8-w intervals(to a maximum of 80 mg for rosuvastatin and simvastatin and 40 mg for pravastatin) forfailure to achieve ATP-II LDL-C goals. At 12 w, LDL-C was reduced significantly morewith both rosuvastatin doses (39 and 47%), compared with simvastatin 20 mg (35%, bothP < 0.05) and pravastatin 20 mg (27%, both P < 0.05) (Table 6). Both rosuvastatin dosesproduced significantly greater reductions in non–HDL-C and apo B, and rosuvastatin10 mg decreased triglycerides significantly more than both simvastatin and pravastatinand increased HDL-C significantly more than pravastatin. At 52 w, mean doses in theinitial rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg groups were 9.5 and 13.8 mg, respectively, whereas thosein the simvastatin and pravastatin groups were 36.3 and 32.6 mg, respectively. ATP-IILDL-C goals were achieved in 88% of the rosuvastatin 5 mg group, 88% of the rosuvasta-tin 10 mg group, 73% of the simvastatin group, and 60% of the pravastatin group, in-cluding 84, 71, 30, and 6%, respectively, of those with the LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL(<2.59 mmol/L). In total, 65% of the rosuvastatin 5 mg group, 79% of the rosuvastatin10 mg group, 50% of the simvastatin group, and 30.5% of the pravastatin group achievedgoals at the starting dose; titration to the 80-mg dose was required to achieve goal in 2% ofthe rosuvastatin 5 mg group, 0% of the rosuvastatin 10 mg group, and 9% of the simvasta-tin group (67). Key lipid responses and achievement of LDL-C goals according to the new ATP-IIIguidelines (21) and the Joint European Societies guidelines (54) have been analyzed withpooled 12-w (starting dose) data from these four comparative trials and an additional com-parative trial of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in high-risk patients. In this latter trial, details of which have yet to be reported, 383 high-risk patients (with documented atheroscle-rotic disease or diabetes) meeting lipid entry criteria identical to those of the other fourstudies received rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg or atorvastatin for 12 w, followed by a 12-wdose-titration period (data on file, AstraZeneca). Pooled analysis of the three comparativetrials with atorvastatin (66) showed that both rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 390) and rosuvastatin10 mg (n = 389) doses produced significantly greater reductions in LDL-C, comparedwith atorvastatin (n = 393) (42 and 47% vs. 36%, both P < 0.001), and that both producedsignificantly greater increases in HDL-C (8 and 9% vs. 5.5%, both P < 0.01). Overall,ATP-III LDL-C goals were achieved by 67% of rosuvastatin 5 mg patients, 76% of rosu-vastatin 10 mg patients, and 53% of atorvastatin 10 mg patients (both P < 0.01 vs. atorva-statin) (Table 7). Both rosuvastatin doses were also associated with a significantly greaterachievement of the aggressive LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL (<2.59 mmol/L) in patientswith CHD or CHD risk equivalents.In analysis of pooled data from the two trials comparing rosuvastatin with simvastatinand pravastatin, both rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 240) and rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 226) pro-duced significantly greater reductions in LDL-C, compared with simvastatin 20 mg(n = 249) (41 and 48% vs. 36%, both P < 0.001) and pravastatin 20 mg (n = 252) (41 and48% vs. 27%, both P < 0.001) (3,23). Rosuvastatin 10 mg increased HDL-C significantlymore than simvastatin 20 mg (9 vs. 6%, P < 0.05) or pravastatin 20 mg (9 vs. 6%,P < 0.05). Overall, ATP-III LDL-C goals were achieved in 71% of rosuvastatin 5 mg pa-tients, 86% of rosuvastatin 10 mg patients, 64% of simvastatin 20 mg patients (P < 0.05 and <0.001), and 49% of pravastatin 20 mg patients (both P < 0.001) (Table 7). Bothrosuvastatin doses also brought significantly more patients to their LDL-C goal of<100 mg/dL (<2.59 mmol/L).In comparative trials with atorvastatin, the Joint European Societies (54) guidelinesLDL-C goal of <116 mg/dL (<3 mmol/L) was reached at week 12 by 82% (319/389) ofpatients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. 51% (202/393) of those receiving atorvastatin 10 mg (27). In high-risk patients (i.e., those with CHD, diabetes, family history of pre-mature CHD or peripheral vascular disease, or 10-y CHD risk >20% based on a logisticregression model), the LDL-C goal was achieved by 81% (255/314) of patients receivingrosuvastatin 10 mg vs. 49% (160/327) of those receiving atorvastatin 10 mg. In compar-ative trials with simvastatin and pravastatin, goal was achieved by 80% (181/226) of rosu-vastatin 10 mg patients vs. 48% (119/248) of simvastatin 20 mg patients and 16%(40/252) of pravastatin 20 mg patients (50). In high-risk patients, goal was achieved in78% (125/161) of the rosuvastatin 10 mg group vs. 47% (90/190) of the simvastatingroup and 13% (24/186) of the pravastatin group. tin, and enables more patients to achieve LDL-C goals. Rosuvastatin treatment in patientswith homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia produces clinically significant LDL-Creductions in the majority of patients. In a randomized, double-blind, 18-w trial (62), 622 patients with heterozygous familialhypercholesterolemia based on clinical and/or genetic criteria who had LDL-C ?220 and<500 mg/dL (?5.69 and <12.93 mmol/L) and triglycerides ?400 mg/dL (?4.52 mmol/L)received rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg, with doses being titrated to 40 and80 mg after 6 and 12 w. After 18 w, LDL-C was reduced by 58% in the rosuvastatin groupand 50% in the atorvastatin group (P < 0.001) and HDL-C was increased by 12 and 3%,respectively (P < 0.001) (Table 8). Rosuvastatin also reduced total cholesterol, apo B, andLDL-C:HDL-C ratio significantly more than atorvastatin. The significant differences fa-voring rosuvastatin treatment with respect to changes in LDL-C and HDL-C were ob-served after 6 and 12 w (i.e., during treatment with 20 and 40 mg doses) (61). ATP-IILDL-C goals were achieved in 61% of rosuvastatin patients and 46% of atorvastatin pa-tients, including 24 vs. 3% of those with the goal of ?100 mg/dL (?2.59 mmol/L). Analy-sis by baseline triglyceride levels showed greater increases in HDL-C at higher triglyceride levels, with increases of 9, 15, and 22% being observed according to triglyceridelevels of <150, 150–250, and >250 mg/dL (<1.69, 1.69–2.82, and >2.82 mmol/L), re-spectively (60). In an open-label, 18-w trial, 44 patients with homozygous familial hypercholester-olemia, aged 8 to 63 y, received rosuvastatin 20 mg increased to 40 and 80 mg after 6 and12 w after completing a 4-w dietary lead-in phase (34). Mean LDL-C level at baseline was515 mg/dL (13.32 mmol/L). After 18 weeks, LDL-C and total cholesterol were reducedby means of 21% and 20%, respectively, with most of the decreases occurring within thefirst 6 w of treatment with rosuvastatin 20 mg. Clinically relevant decreases in LDL-C(15% or greater) occurred in 29 (72.5%) of 40 patients, and reductions of greater than 30%occurred in 13 (32.5%). In studies involving hypertriglyceridemic patients, rosuvastatin significantly reducedtriglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), non–HDL-C, andLDL-C, with analysis of changes in apo B–containing lipoprotein fractions indicatingmarked reductions in all measures and normalization of particle composition.In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (25,26), 156 patients withtriglyceride levels ?300 and <800 mg/dL (?3.39 and <9.03 mmol/L; type IIb or IV dys-lipidemia) received placebo or rosuvastatin 5–80 mg for 6 w. Triglyceride levels were sig-nificantly reduced, compared with placebo, at all rosuvastatin dose levels, with reductionsranging from 18 to 40% (Table 9). Significant reductions in LDL-C, non–HDL-C,VLDL-C, apo C-III, and non–HDL-C:HDL-C and apo B:apo A-I ratios occurred at eachdose level, and significant increases in HDL-C occurred at all dose levels except 5 mg(range, 4–18%). All doses reduced the triglyceride content of LDL, VLDL, and HDL andthe apo B content of LDL and VLDL.In a study examining the effects of rosuvastatin 40 mg on concentration and compo-sition of apo B–containing lipoprotein subfractions (10), patients were divided into ahypertriglyceridemic group (triglycerides >177 mg/dL [>2.00 mmol/L] and LDL-C106–215 mg/dL [2.75–5.55 mmol/L], n = 18) and a normotriglyceridemic group (triglyc-erides <177 mg/dL [<2.00 mmol/L] and LDL-C 131–220 mg/dL [3.40–5.70 mmol/L],n = 14). In all patients, rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C by a mean of 59% and triglyceridesby a mean of 28%; the reduction in LDL-C was inversely related to baseline triglycerides,and the reduction in triglycerides was positively related to baseline triglycerides. Rosuva-statin reduced both cholesteryl ester and free cholesterol contents of all apo B–containinglipoproteins, including remnants and small dense LDL, in both hypertriglyceridemic andnormotriglyceridemic groups (Table 10) and normalized particle composition. Some ofthe effects (e.g., those on VLDL2 and LDL-C) were phenotype independent, whereassome (e.g., those on VLDL1, remnant lipoprotein cholesterol, and LDL III) were de-pendent on the baseline lipid profile. In the hypertriglyceridemic group, rosuvastatinlargely corrected the atherogenic LDL profile, with LDL III concentrations falling to?100 mg/dL (?2.59 mmol/L) in 16 of 18 patients. Rosuvastatin has been evaluated alone and in combination with fenofibrate in mixeddyslipidemia patients (type IIb/IV) with type 2 diabetes (18,19), with extended-releaseniacin (ERN) in patients with mixed dyslipidemia (type IIb /IV) (9,40), and with chole-styramine in hypercholesterolemic patients (2). In diabetic patients and patients withmixed dyslipidemia, rosuvastatin monotherapy improved most lipid measures as much as,or more than, combinations of lower-dose rosuvastatin with fenofibrate or ERN, sug-gesting a potential role for monotherapy in some patients in these settings. Advantages ofcombination therapy included a significantly greater reduction in triglycerides with the ro-suvastatin/fenofibrate combination and a significantly greater increase in HDL-C with therosuvastatin/ERN combination. No differences in changes in lipid measures were ob-served between high-dose rosuvastatin alone and in combination with cholestyramine inhypercholesterolemic patients. Rosuvastatin monotherapy was generally better toleratedthan combined treatment, but the combination did not produce any unexpected or seriousadverse events.In a 24-w trial (18,19), 216 hyperlipidemic (type IIb or IV dyslipidemia) type 2 diabeticpatients with triglycerides ?200 and <800 mg/dL (?2.26 and <9.03 mmol/L), total cho-lesterol ?200 mg/dL (?5.17 mmol/L), and HbA1c <10% were randomized to double-blindrosuvastatin 5 or 10 mg or one of two placebo groups for 6 w. During the subsequent18-w, open-label, dose-titration phase, fenofibrate titrated from 67 mg once daily to threetimes daily was added to both rosuvastatin groups, one placebo group received rosuvasta-tin 10–40 mg, and one placebo group received fenofibrate 67 mg one to three times dailyif LDL-C remained above 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L). After 6 w, both rosuvastatin groupshad significantly reduced triglycerides, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and apo B and signifi-cantly increased HDL-C, compared with the combined placebo groups (all P < 0.001).After 24 w, combined treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg/fenofibrate 67 mg three timesdaily produced a significantly greater reduction in triglycerides, compared with rosuvasta-tin 10–40 mg alone (47 vs. 30%, P = 0.001) (Table 11). Rosuvastatin 10–40 mg alone re-duced LDL-C significantly more than both combination treatment with rosuvastatin5mg/fenofibrate and fenofibrate monotherapy. Increases in HDL-C were comparable inall groups. All groups exhibited favorable changes in lipid subfractions. Combinationtreatment was well tolerated.In a 24-w, open-label trial (9,40), 270 patients with total cholesterol ?200 mg/dL(?5.17 mmol/L), triglycerides ?200 and ?800 mg/dL (?2.26 and ?9.03 mmol/L; type IIbor IV dyslipidemia), and HDL-C <45 mg/dL (<1.16 mmol/L) were randomized to one offour dose-titrated monotherapy or combination therapy arms: rosuvastatin 10–40 mg;ERN 0.5–2 g; rosuvastatin 10–40 mg + ERN 0.5–1 g; and rosuvastatin 10 mg + ERN0.5–2 g. Rosuvastatin alone reduced LDL-C by 48%, significantly more than ERN alone(0%, P < 0.017) and significantly more than combined treatment with rosuvastatin10 mg/ERN 2 g (36%, P < 0.017) (Table 12); similar differences in reductions were ob-served in apo B (42 vs. 9 and 34%, both P < 0.017) and non–HDL-C (49 vs. 11% and38%, both P < 0.017). Combination treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg/ERN 2 g producedsignificantly greater increases than rosuvastatin alone in HDL-C (24 vs. 11%), HDL2 (41vs. 9%), and apo A-I (11 vs. 5%; all P < 0.017). Rosuvastatin alone was better toleratedthan ERN alone or rosuvastatin/ERN combinations, with most withdrawals due to adverse events being attributable to characteristic niacin side effects. No clinically signif-icant elevations in liver transaminases or creatine kinase and no increased risk ofmyopathy were observed with combined treatment. In a 12-w trial (2), 147 patients with LDL-C ?190 and ?400 mg/dL (?4.91 and ?10.34mmol/L) and triglycerides <400 mg/dL (<4.52 mmol/L; heterozygous familial or nonfa-milial hypercholesterolemia) received rosuvastatin 40 mg for 6 w and were subsequentlyrandomized to rosuvastatin 80 mg alone or rosuvastatin 80 mg + cholestyramine 8 g twicedaily for 6 w. After 12 w, there were no significant differences between the rosuvastatingroup and the rosuvastatin/cholestyramine group in reductions in LDL-C (56 vs. 61%),total cholesterol (43 vs. 46%), triglycerides (23 vs. 26%), or apo B (47 vs. 48%) or in in-creases in HDL-C (11 vs. 10%) or apo A-I (8 vs. 10%). No unexpected safety issues arosewith combined treatment. In clinical evaluation, rosuvastatin treatment has been well tolerated and has shown anadverse event profile similar to that observed with placebo or comparator statins. Pooledanalysis of rosuvastatin data from phase II/III trials indicates no unexpected adverse ef-fects based on the drug’s preclinical profile or from consideration of the safety profiles ofother drugs in the statin class (57). In placebo-controlled phase II /III trials, adverse eventsirrespective of causality attribution occurred in 55% of 647 patients receiving rosuvastatinand 53% of 289 receiving placebo and were similar between groups. In all controlledphase II/III trials, adverse events irrespective of causality attribution occurred in 63.6% of2579 patients receiving rosuvastatin (all doses pooled) and in 64.9% of 1275 patients re-ceiving comparator statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin), with both groupshaving similar frequencies of serious adverse events, adverse events leading to study with-drawal, and treatment-related adverse events (Table 13). The most common adverseevents in the 2579 patients in controlled phase II/III trials were pharyngitis, pain, head-ache, flu syndrome, and myalgia. Among 3747 patients receiving rosuvastatin in all un-controlled and controlled phase II/III trials, clinically significant increases in alanineaminotransferase (levels more than three times the upper limit of normal on two suc-cessive occasions) occurred in 0.5% during rosuvastatin treatment. The incidence of my-opathy (creatine kinase increase to >10 times the upper limit of normal + muscle symp-toms) was 0.2%. All cases of myopathy occurred in patients receiving rosuvastatin 80 mg, and all occurred in patients who were randomized directly to or force-titrated to this dose(i.e., dose increase was not based on LDL-C response to treatment).Following a regularly scheduled review of the benefit:risk ratio for rosuvastatin, Astra-Zeneca is not seeking approval of the 80-mg dose at the current time. Most patients hadreached the 80-mg dose through forced titration or direct randomization, with very few re-quiring titration to the maximum dose to achieve LDL-C goals, and the optimal use of thisdose has not yet been shown. The 80-mg dose will be reviewed for possible introductionat a future date.There has been little experience with reduction of LDL-C to well below guidelinelevels. Since rosuvastatin is highly effective in reducing LDL-C, the safety profile was as-sessed in patients reaching low LDL-C levels during rosuvastatin treatment. No differencewas observed in the overall safety profile vs. that reported for patients achieving LDL-Cof <80 mg/dL (<2.07 mmol/L) or <50 mg/dL (<1.29 mmol/L) on at least one occasionduring treatment (53). Among 2,579 patients receiving rosuvastatin in controlled phaseII/III trials, LDL-C <80 mg/dL (<2.07 mmol/L) occurred in 971 patients, and levels<50 mg/dL (<1.29 mmol/L) occurred in 149. Compared with the overall frequency of ad-verse events irrespective of causality attribution in this population (63.6%), the frequencywas 39.3% in patients with LDL-C <80 mg/dL (<2.07 mmol/L) and 28.2% in those withlevels <50 mg/dL (<1.29 mmol/L). The most common types of adverse events were simi-lar in the overall population and in the two low LDL-C subgroups (Table 14). Creatinekinase elevation was reported in 2.1% of patients overall, 1.4% of patients with LDL-C<80 mg/dL (<2.07 mmol/L), and 0.7% of patients with LDL-C <50 mg/dL(<1.29 mmol/L). Rosuvastatin is a new statin with a number of advantageous pharmacological prop-erties, including enhanced HMG-CoA reductase binding characteristics, relative hydro-philicity, and selective uptake into, and activity in, hepatic cells. CYP metabolism of rosu-vastatin, which appears to be minimal, is principally mediated by the 2C9 enzyme, withlittle involvement of 3A4; consistent with these observations is the absence of clinicallysignificant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with other drugs known to inhibit CYPenzymes.Dose-ranging studies in hypercholesterolemic patients showed dose-dependent effectsin reducing LDL-C (up to 63%), total cholesterol, and apo B across a 1- to 40-mg doserange and a significant 8.4% additional reduction in LDL-C, compared with atorvastatin,across the dose ranges of the two agents.Rosuvastatin has been shown to be highly effective in reducing LDL-C, increasingHDL-C, and favorably modifying other elements of the atherogenic lipid profile in a widerange of dyslipidemic patients. In patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia,rosuvastatin treatment has produced large decreases in LDL-C at starting doses and re-duced the need for subsequent dose titration. The large reductions in LDL-C and improve-ments in other lipid measures with rosuvastatin treatment promise to facilitate goalachievement and reduce the need for combination therapy in patients with severe hyper-cholesterolemia. Moreover, the effects of rosuvastatin in reducing triglycerides, triglyc-eride-containing lipoproteins, non–HDL-C, and LDL-C and increasing HDL-C in patientswith mixed dyslipidemia or elevated triglycerides should be of considerable utility inachieving LDL-C and non–HDL-C goals in the many patients with combined dyslipide-mias or metabolic syndrome who require lipid-lowering therapy. Rosuvastatin is well tol-erated alone, and in combination with fenofibrate, ERN, and cholestyramine, and has asafety profile similar to that of currently marketed statins.A large, long-term clinical trials program has been initiated to investigate the effects ofrosuvastatin on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This initiative,known as the GALAXY Program, will assess the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin in awide range of patients and pathological processes (15). Areas of investigation will includethe slowing of atherosclerosis progression in low-risk asymptomatic patients, assessmentof lipids and pleiotropic effects in patients with acute coronary syndrome, reduction in ep-isodes of myocardial ischemia in patients with proven coronary artery disease, and the useof rosuvastatin in patients with/at risk of cardiovascular disease for whom there is cur-rently no evidence of benefit from statin therapy. The GALAXY Program will also ex-amine the relationship between lipid control and cardiovascular risk reduction, the attain-ment of guideline treatment goals, and initiatives designed to improve patient compliancewith statin therapy.
