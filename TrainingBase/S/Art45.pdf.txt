(Table 1).
    However, many abnormally large spermatogonia were
seen in the irradiated knock out mice (Figure 3B, arrows).
These spermatogonia were mostly single cells, but
occasionally pairs were seen. A sevenfold increase was
found in the percentage of tubular cross-sections showing
one or more giant spermatogonia, laying at the basal
membrane, in irradiated knock out compared to wild-type
mice (Table 1, Figure 3A and B). No significant increase in
the number of giant spermatogonia was seen in the

were evaluated. Ten days after irradiation, surviving A2-B
