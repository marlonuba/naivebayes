W-77-Sepharose affinity column. Details of the condition are de-
scribed under "Experimental Procedures." Fractions of 1 ml were
collected, and their absorption a t 280 nm was monitored. The EGTA-
elutable protein peak was observed when the EGTA extract from
brain or retina was applied to each column ( A ) (brain, 0,retina, W).
