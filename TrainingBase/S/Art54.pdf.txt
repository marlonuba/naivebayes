Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics
in Trypanosoma brucei by the mitochondrial
calcium uniporter
Guozhong Huang1, Anibal E. Vercesi2 & Roberto Docampo1



Mechanisms of regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in trypanosomes are not completely
understood. Here we present evidence that the Trypanosoma brucei mitochondrial calcium
uniporter (TbMCU) is essential for the regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics, autophagy
and cell death, even in the bloodstream forms that are devoid of a functional respiratory chain
and oxidative phosphorylation. Localization studies reveal its co-localization with MitoTracker
staining. TbMCU overexpression increases mitochondrial Ca2 þ accumulation in intact and
permeabilized trypanosomes, generates excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and sensitizes them to apoptotic stimuli. Ablation of TbMCU in RNAi or conditional
knockout trypanosomes reduces mitochondrial Ca2 þ uptake without affecting their mem-
brane potential, increases the AMP/ATP ratio, stimulates autophagosome formation and
produces marked defects in growth in vitro and infectivity in mice, revealing its essentiality in
these parasites. The requirement of TbMCU for proline and pyruvate metabolism in procyclic
and bloodstream forms, respectively, reveals its role in regulation of mitochondrial
bioenergetics.

Figure 2 | Silencing of TbMCU expression decreases Ca2 þ uptake of digitonin-permeabilized PCF and BSF trypanosomes. (a) The reaction
buffer contained 2 mM succinate and 1 mM Calcium Green 5-N. After several pulses of Ca2 þ (8 mM ﬁnal concentration) cells (5  107 trypanosomes
grown in the absence (black tracing) or presence (green tracing) of tetracycline) were added to the reaction medium (2.45 ml) and the reaction was
started adding 50 mM digitonin. Ruthenium red (RR, 40 mM, yellow and red tracing), and FCCP (5 mM) were added where indicated. A decrease in
ﬂuorescence indicates decreasing medium Ca2 þ or increasing vesicular Ca2 þ . (b) Relative Ca2 þ uptake at 700 s as compared with that of control
trypanosomes grown in the absence of tetracycline considered as 1.0 (  Tet) (means±s.d., n ¼ 3, **Po0.001, Student’s t-test). (c) Similar conditions as in
a except that further CaCl2 additions (8 mM each time) were added to  Tet trypanosomes to show the high mitochondrial capacity to take up Ca2 þ . EGTA
(8 mM) and CaCl2 (Ca2 þ ) were added where indicated to show the presence of medium Ca2 þ . (d) Relative initial rate of Ca2 þ uptake by þ Tet as
compared with  Tet trypanosomes (means±s.d., n ¼ 3, **Po0.001, Student’s t-test). (e) Representative traces of Ca2 þ uptake kinetics in digitonin-
permeabilized TbMCU BSF trypanosomes cultured in the absence (  Tet) or presence ( þ Tet) of tetracycline. The reactions were started adding 40 mM
digitonin in the presence of 1 mM ATP and 500 mM sodium orthovanadate. Ca2 þ uptake was monitored over time using 1 mM Calcium Green-5N.
Ruthenium red (RR, 40 mM, yellow and red tracings), oligomycin (Oligo, 2.5 mg ml  1), EGTA (0.4 mM) and CaCl2 (pulses of 0.4 mM) were added where
indicated. (f) Relative Ca2 þ uptake at 200 s as compared with that of control BSF trypanosomes grown in the absence of tetracycline considered
as 1 (  Tet) (means±s.d., n ¼ 3, *( þ Tet±RR), **(  Tet±RR), ***(  Tet/ þ Tet) , Po0.001, Student’s t-test).

Figure 5 | Changes in BSF trypanosomes after conditional KO of TbMCU. (a) Growth of TbMCU-KO BSF in the absence (black line) or presence (red line)
of 1 mg ml  1 tetracycline for the indicated number of days. Addition of 10 mM threonine to the medium (green line) partially rescued the mutant BSF
trypanosomes but had no effect on þ Tet cells (yellow line; means±s.d., n ¼ 3, **Po0.001, Student’s t-test). (b) Southern blot analysis of the BSF
conditional KOs. Genomic DNA from the T. brucei SM parental strain ( þ / þ ), single- ( þ /  ) or double-allele (  /  ) KO cells. (c) Northern blot analysis
of wild-type (WT) and TbMCU-KO BSF cultured in the presence ( þ Tet) or absence (  Tet) of tetracycline for 2 days. Tubulin is shown as a loading
control (bottom panel). (d) Western blot analysis of total cell lysates. Proteins from BSF trypanosomes cultured in the presence ( þ Tet) or absence (  Tet)
of tetracycline were detected using anti-HA antibody. TbVDAC was used as a loading control. (e) Immunoﬂuorescence analysis of control (upper panels)
and TbMCU-KO (lower panels) trypanosomes. TbMCU co-localized with MitoTracker (MT) in the control parasites ( þ Tet; PCC ¼ 0.808). Scale bar, 10 mm.
(f) Conditional TbMCU-KO BSF trypanosomes were grown in the presence ( þ Tet) or absence (  Tet) of tetracycline for 2 days. BSF trypanosomes
(2  108 cells) were incubated as in Fig. 2e. Multiple pulses of CaCl2 (arrowheads) were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 mM. A representative
trace (red or black) of Ca2 þ uptake from one of three independent experiments is shown. (g) Representative traces of mitochondrial membrane
potential of digitonin-permeabilized BSF trypanosomes grown in the presence ( þ Tet) or absence (  Tet) of tetracycline. The reactions were incubated
as in Fig. 3c. CaCl2 (50 mM), EGTA (200 mM) and FCCP (10 mM) were added where indicated. (h,i) Changes in safranine ﬂuorescence after addition of

as in Fig. 2c. Multiple pulses of CaCl2 (arrowheads) were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 8 mM. (e) Ca2 þ uptake in TbMCU-OE PCF ( þ Tet) 200 s

on apoptotic challenge of control (  Tet) or TbMCU-OE ( þ Tet) PCF trypanosomes with H2O2 and C2-ceramide. The percentage of cell death was
obtained from means±s.d. by analysing 460 ﬁelds (including 4400 cells) (n ¼ 3). **Po0.01, Student’s t-test.
