Abstract

   We have previously demonstrated that Phytomonas serpens, a tomato parasite, shares antigens with Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoa
that causes Chagas’ disease. These antigens are recognized by human sera and induce protective immunity in Balb/c mice. In the present
study, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout (KO) mice and C57BL/6 mice treated with the nitric oxide inhibitor, aminoguanidine
(AG, 50 mg kg−1 ) infected with T. cruzi, were used to demonstrate the role of nitric oxide (NO) to host protection against T. cruzi infection
achieved by oral immunization with live P. serpens. A reduction in parasitaemia and an increase in survival were observed in C57BL/6
infected mice and previously immunized with P. serpens, when compared to non-immunized mice. iNOS (KO) mice immunized and C57BL/6
immunized and treated with AG presented parasitaemia and mortality rates comparable to those of infected and non-immunized mice. By itself,
immunization with P. serpens did not induce inflammation in the myocardium, but C57BL/6 mice so immunized showed fewer amastigotes
nests in the heart following an acute T. cruzi infection than those in non-immunized mice. These results suggest that protective immunity
against T. cruzi infection induced by immunization with P. serpens is dependent upon enhanced NO production during the acute phase
of T. cruzi infection.

2.5. Stat´ıstical analysis

    Arithmetic means (parasitaemia, amastigotes nests, and
inflammatory foci) and standard deviations of means were
calculated. The impact of infection and other treatments
were determined by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
When significant main effects were noted, differences be-
tween individual groups were tested using Bonferroni mul-
tiple comparisons method. Survival curves were compared
using the Mantel–Haenszel log rank test. All statistical anal-
ysis was made using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA).

3.1. Parasitaemia and survival rates

    To address the question of the role of nitric oxide in the
protection induced by immunization with P. serpens in mice
challenged with T. cruzi and its association with disease de-
velopment, two murine models of Chagas’ disease were used.
These vary with respect to the resistance (C57BL/6, wild type
mice, WT) and susceptibility (iNOs−/− ; knockout mice, KO)
to the infection with T. cruzi (Y strain).
    Fig. 1 shows the course of infection of C57BL/6 and
iNOS−/− mice infected with T. cruzi and immunized or
not with P. serpens. In the 7 days following inoculation
with T. cruzi, parasitaemia was similar between WT immu-
nized and non-immunized (C57BL/6 versus C57BL/6 IM;
P > 0.05) mice. However, on day 9 after infection, para-
sitic load in the blood peaked 9 was significantly higher in
