             Kinetoplastid RNA editing is a posttranscriptional insertion and deletion of U residues in mitochondrial
          transcripts that involves RNA ligase. A complex of seven different polypeptides purified from Trypanosoma
          brucei mitochondria that catalyzes accurate RNA editing contains RNA ligases of ⬃57 kDa (band IV) and ⬃50
          kDa (band V). From a partial amino acid sequence, cDNA and genomic clones of band IV were isolated, making
          it the first cloned component of the minimal RNA editing complex. It is indeed an RNA ligase, for when
          expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein autoadenylylates and catalyzes RNA joining. Overexpression studies
          revealed that T. brucei can regulate of total band IV protein at the level of translation or protein stability, even
          upon massively increased mRNA levels. The protein’s mitochondrial targeting was confirmed by its location,
          size when expressed in T. brucei and E. coli, and N-terminal sequence. Importantly, genetic knockout studies
          demonstrated that the gene for band IV is essential in procyclic trypanosomes. The band IV and band V RNA
          ligases of the RNA editing complex therefore serve different functions. We also identified the gene for band V
          RNA ligase, a protein much more homologous to band IV than to other known ligases.

correspond to the new sequences obtained from the PCR using primers IV.1(3) and IV.2(4), and the uppercase residues correspond to those
additionally obtained from cDNA clone IV.13. The first AUG and in-frame termination codons are in italics with solid or dotted underlining,
respectively. Other conserved amino acid motifs discussed in the text are indicated by dotted underlining. The oligonucleotides used as PCR
primers the entire expressed protein region and for the 5⬘ region of the mRNA and are indicated by dotted overlining on lines 5 and 30
(oligonucleotides IV.3) and by dotted underlining on line 6 (oligonucleotide IV.4(4)). The latter clones showed miniexon trans splicing to either
of the double-underlined purine residues on line 3 (see panel C). The longer cDNAs derived from strain TREU 667 contain a G residue just
upstream from the position of the trans-splice site used in the shorter cDNA (the lowercase g residue on line 3), while cDNA IV.13 isolated from
the library generated from WRATat (12) has an A at that position; a second apparent polymorphism is that the two former cDNA kinds both
contain an extra GTG (valine) codon inserted after codon 14 (indicated by the diagonal overline). (B) Northern blot of 2 ␮g of strain TREU 667

   FIG. 5. Expression of the band IV construct in trypanosomes. (A) Plasmid piT7LigIV, used for inducible overexpression of band IV cDNA in
transfected trypanosomes, has a T7 promoter with a tet operator driving expression of the band IV ORF and a linked phleomycin resistance gene
(Phl, the ble gene from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus) plus the indicated 5⬘ trans-splicing and 3⬘ polyadenylation signals to allow normal
trypanosome mRNA processing (47). Transcription stops at the T7 terminator before reading into the pGEM vector sequences. Linearization
within the adjoining segment derived from the transcriptionally silent rRNA gene (rDNA) intergenic spacer allows homologous targeting to this
region of the host chromosome, with the desired ORF reading in the reverse orientation of the rRNA gene. This DNA was electroporated into
procyclic cell line 29.13, which expresses T7 RNA polymerase and TetR to allow regulation of the TC-responsive T7 promoter (47). In plasmid
piT7␣LigIV, the band IV ORF cassette was, instead, inserted in the antisense orientation. Term, termination signal; PARP, procyclic acid repeat

cloned band IVa gene (cell lines C and D), without and at various times following TC induction. To score molecules that were already adenylylated
in the extract, the assays were performed following PPi treatment (29). (C) Northern blotting of RNAs from similarly uninduced and induced
