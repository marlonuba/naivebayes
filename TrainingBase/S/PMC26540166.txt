                                               consists of Malformin A1, A2, A3 and A4 [5, 6], in which Malformin A1 is most well-studied,
                                               and its biological activities have been reported including malformations of plants, antibiotic

                                               potent antimalarial and antitrypanosomal properties [13]. Also, Malformin C inhibits bleomy-

                                           Although the incidence and mortality of colon and rectal cancers have decreased in the past
                                        twenty years, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and
                                        the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States [15]. Chemotherapy is commonly
                                        used for CRC at different stages. Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar) is a chemotherapeutic drug that
                                        prevents DNA from unwinding by inhibition of topoisomerase I action, and is used for the treat-
                                        ment of advanced or metastatic CRC. In this study, we used murine Colon 38 cells, HCT116 cells
                                        and allograft tumor as the model to study the potential of Malformin C’s anti-cancer property and
                                        chose CPT-11 as a control to explore its possible combination and underlying mechanism.

                                        Materials and Methods
                                        Fungal Material
                                        The culture of Aspergillus tubingensis was isolated from the sand soil of the Patong beach of
                                        Phuket, Thai island (7.89°N, 98.29°E). The sand soil was collected from a public beach, and no
                                        specific permission was required for that location or such activity. We confirm that our field
                                        studies did not involve endangered or protected species. The isolate was identified by one of
                                        the authors (Prof. Yixuan Zhang) based on sequence analysis of the ITS region of the rDNA
                                        and its morphology. The strain was assigned the Accession No. 6992 culture collection at the
                                        China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center, Beijing. The fungal strain was cul-
                                        tured on slants of potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 28°C for 4 days. Then the slants spores were
                                        inoculated in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 40ml of media (1% glucose, 1%
                                        sucrose, 1% peptone, 0.5% peanut meal, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.3% MgSO47H2O) and
                                        the final pH of the media was adjusted to 6.5 before sterilization. Flask cultures were incubated
                                        at 28°C on a rotary shaker at 160 rpm for 48 hours to obtain seed liquid for fermentation. Fer-
                                        mentation was carried out in Fernbach culture flasks (500ml) each containing 80ml of media
                                        (1% glucose, 0.2% aspartic acid, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.05% MgSO47H2O and trace elements) and
                                        the final pH 6.0 before sterilization. The trace elements per 1L fermentation media contained
                                        0.1mg MnSO4, 0.1mg ZnSO4, 0.2mg FeCl3, 1mg Vitamin B1, 5μg biotin. 8% (volume ratio)
                                        seed liquid were planted into each fermentation bottle, then cultured at 28°C on a rotary shaker
                                        at 160 rpm for 96 hours.

                                        Extraction, isolation and identification of Malformin C
                                        20L fermentation material was vacuum filtered to remove mycelium, then extracted with N-butyl
                                        alcohol, and the organic solvent was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to yield a crude extract.
                                        5g crude extract was dissolved in CH3OH followed by silica gel column chromatography (CC)
                                        (10×100cm) using CHCl3-CH3OH gradient elution (15:1!10:1!5:1). The fraction (0.8g) eluted
                                        with 15:1 CHCl3-CH3OH was separated by column chromatography, and further purification by

                                        pure compound was identified on the basis of extensive spectroscopic investigation including
                                        HR-ESI-MS, 1D-NMR and 2D-NMR. HR-ESI-MS spectra were obtained on a Bruker micro-
                                        Q-TOF mass spectrometer. 1D and 2D-NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker ARX-300 spec-
                                        trometer (300 MHz for 1H, 75 MHz for 13C). The pure compound was identified as malformin C
                                        via comparison of data with those previously reported [16].

                                        in the lab and described before [18–22]. Colon 38, NCI-H1975, CEM and KB cells were cultured
                                        in RPMI 1640 medium, PanO2 cells were cultured in DMEM medium, and HCT 116 cells in
                                        McCoy's 5a medium. KB-resistant cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 37nmol/L Doxoru-

                                        cells were treated with drugs for 72 hours, 72 hours, 72 hours, 120 hours, 72 hours, 120 hours,
                                        72 hours, 108 hours, 72 hours, 108 hours, and 108 hours, respectively. Cells were fixed and
                                        stained with 0.5% methylene blue in 50% ethanol for 2 hours at room temperature (RT), fol-
                                        lowed by washing with tap water to remove the unabsorbed methylene blue. Plates were air
                                        dried overnight, solubilized in 1% Sarkosyl and rotated for 3 hours at room RT. Cell growth
                                        was quantitated based on the amount of methylene blue adsorbed to interact with cellular pro-
                                        teins measured by spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) at 595 nm. The values were aver-
                                        aged and the day zero value was subtracted from each averaged value including the untreated
                                        control. The drug treated values were expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, and
                                        percentages were plotted vs. drug concentration to generate an IC50 value. All experiments
                                        were performed in duplicate wells and were repeated at least three times.

                                        treated with Malformin C or Oxaliplatin for 24 hours. The next day cells were harvested and
                                        seeded into new six-well plates at 300/well with fresh culture medium. The colonies were
                                        stained with methylene blue after 11 days and then counted. The results included the means
                                        and S.D. obtained from three independent experiments.


                                        Cell Cycle Analysis
                                        Colon 38 and HCT 116 cells were seeded separately onto six-well plates at 3×105 cells per well,
                                        and incubated for 48 hours. Various concentrations of Malformin C or Oxaliplatin were added
                                        to the culture media and incubated for another 24 hours. Cells were then harvested using pan-
                                        creatin and 10μg/mL DNase1, 37°C, 5min and washed twice with cold PBS. A total of 1x106
                                        cells for each sample were aliquoted, resuspended in 500μL PBS and fixed by adding 500μl 4%
                                        PFA. After 30 minutes incubation on ice, the samples were washed twice with cold PBS. Prior

                                        Colon 38 cells were treated with different concentrations of Malformin C for three different
                                        time courses including 24-hour treatment, 48-hour treatment, and 24-hour treatment followed
                                        by Malformin C withdrawal and another 24-hour incubation. All the cells were fixed with 4%
                                        paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. 3% bovine
                                        serum albumin in PBS was used to block nonspecific binding. Cells were then exposed to

                                        by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:400 dilution. Cytoplasmic actin
                                        was counter-stained with 0.25μg/ml rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen). The cells were then
                                        sealed in antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Confocal micrographs were scanned by a laser scanning

                                        appeared very sick that was cold to the touch, hunched, could not move, eat or drink normally
                                        from the treatment was euthanized with 30% isoflurane (mixture of 30% v/v isoflurane and
                                        70% propylene glycol) inhalation and cervical dislocation. After 10 to 14 days, mice with
                                        tumor sizes of 150–300 mm3 were selected into a pool, and then randomly allocated to different
                                        groups, with 5 mice in each group. Malformin C was dissolved at 10mM DMSO and the final
                                        concentration of DMSO was lower than 0.05% of the Malformin C solution used for treatment.
                                        Different concentrations of sterilized malformin C (0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 0.9mg/kg, 1.8mg/kg,
                                        2.6mg/kg) and sterilized PBS were administered intra-peritoneally (i.p.) in the morning from
                                        Day 1. After the whole treatment, blood samples were collected following anesthetization with
                                        30% isoflurane inhalation, and then the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Tumor
                                        tissue samples were collected after the mice were confirmed dead and frozen in -70°C for future
                                        study. For pathological study of Malformin C’s acute toxicity, we randomly assigned six mice
                                        into PBS group and 1.8mg/kg Malformin C group. Drugs were injected i.p. and all the subjects
                                        were monitored every 15 minutes for 6 hours until mice in Malformin C group were close to
                                        death. Then mice were euthanized, blood samples were taken for chemistry, part of the spleen
                                        and peritoneum were cultured for bacteriology, and the rest of tissues examined were fixed in

                                        Plasma cytokine assay
                                        The plasma cytokine assay was carried out following the instruction manual of BD Cytometric
                                        Bead Array (CBA) Mouse Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit instruction manual. The mouse Th1/Th2
                                        cytokine standards were reconstituted in assay diluent and serially diluted to the concentration
                                        of 0-5000pg/ml. An amount of 10μl of each test mouse cytokine capture bead suspension was
                                        mixed, and 50μl of standard dilutions or test mixed beads were transferred to assay tubes. After
                                        adding 50μl of PE detection reagent, the samples were incubated at RT for 2 hours. Then the
                                        samples were washed, and 300μl of wash buffer was added to each tube. All the samples were
                                        analyzed using BD FACS Array System.

                                        Statistical Analysis
                                        Data was analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (GraphPad Prism 5),
                                        Student’s t test (Microsoft Office Excel), and correlation analysis (GraphPad Prism 5). The dif-
                                        ference was considered to be statistically significant when P<0.05.

                                        (S1 Table). Malformin C had different inhibition effects among different cancer cell lines
                                        (P<0.01, one-way ANOVA), and the Malformin C was more potent than L-OddC for growth
                                        inhibition of Colon 38, HCT 116 and PanO2 (P<0.01, t test). Therefore, we selected Colon 38
                                        and HCT 116 for the following study. The actions of Malformin C on the colony-forming abil-
                                        ity of Colon 38 and HCT116 were then determined as the percentage of visible colony numbers
                                        of drug-treated group compared to non-treatment control group by clonogenic assay. Colon
                                        38 and HCT 116 cells exhibited a dose-dependent loss of colony-forming ability after exposed
                                        to Malformin C with a LC50 value of 0.6±0.07 μM and 0.7±0.09 μM respectively, which was
                                        defined as the concentration of drug that inhibited colony formation by 50%. The ratio of LC50
                                        to IC50 was approximately 2:1 in Colon 38 cells and 4:1 in HCT 116 cells, and this result indi-
                                        cated that the Malformin C’s effects on the growth inhibition of Colon 38 and HCT 116 were
                                        partially irreversible.

                                        cer drugs, were studied employing KB cell line and a number of well-characterized KB drug-
                                        resistant cell lines (Table 1). Malformin C displayed a 233-fold resistance to KB-MDR cells that
                                        overexpressed human P-gp 170 protein, when compared to KB cells (P<0.0001). It was also
                                        4.4-fold resistant to KBv20c cells (P<0.001) and 2.8-fold more sensitive to KB300-CPT cells
                                        (P<0.05) compared to KB cells (Table 2). In order to further confirm Malformin C’s resistance
                                        to KB-MDR cells, Verapamil (VRP), a calcium channel antagonist of P-gp 170 protein, was
                                        used to reverse multidrug resistance [28]. A non-toxic concentration of VRP (5 μM) was
                                        administrated to KB resistant cells in addition to Malformin C, Taxol and Doxarubicin for 72
                                        hours. With VRP, the IC50 of Malformin C for KB-MDR had significantly decreased, from
                                        233-fold to 4-fold of that of KB cells (Table 3). This data shows that KB-MDR cells were highly
                                        resistant to Malformin C and the drug-resistant effect was reversed by VRP.

                                        Malformin C caused G2/M arrest in Colon 38 cell line
                                        The impacts of Malformin C on cell cycle phase distribution of Colon 38 and HCT 116 cells
                                        were examined and a concentration of 90nM, 270nM, 810nM of Malformin C was adminis-
                                        trated respectively for 24 hours and 48 hours. As illustrated in Fig 1, the percentage of G2-M
                                        phase gradually yet significantly increased in Colon 38 cells treated with 270nM and 810nM
                                        Malformin C in both 24-hour (Fig 1B and 1D) and 48-hour (Fig 1C and 1D) experiments.
                                        Conversely, the percentage of G1 phase decreased in cells exposed to 810nM Malformin C.
                                        These results implied that Malformin C induced a dose-dependent G2-M arrest in Colon 38
                                        cells. However, no time-dependent changes of cell cycle progression were observed in Colon 38
                                        cells (Fig 1D, S1 Fig), and no cell cycle pattern changes were found in HCT 116 cells (S2 Fig).
                                        Furthermore, we examined the effects of Malformin C on the cell cycle progression of Colon

                                                      38 cells exposed to SN38 for 24 hours. All the cells were treated with an increasing dosage of
                                                      Malformin C (0nM, 30nM, 100nM, 300nM) in addition to no drug or 9nM SN38, respectively.
                                                      Irinotecan (CPT-11) is an analog of camptothecin-a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Inside the
                                                      body, it is converted into the active metabolite SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin) by
                                                      hepatic and intestinal carboxyesterases, and SN38 has a much higher potency in vitro causing
                                                      serious DNA damage which leads to G2-M arrest in cancer cells. In this study, again we con-
                                                      firmed that when treated with 300nM Malformin C alone, the percentage of G2-M phase
                                                      Colon 38 cells increased significantly compared to the control (Fig 1E). Additionally, SN38
                                                      induced G2-M arrest in Colon 38 cells and served as a positive control. There was no signifi-
                                                      cant difference of the progression pattern between Colon 38 cells treated with SN38 alone and
                                                      those treated with Malformin C in addition to SN38 (Fig 1E).

                                                      Induction of tumor suppressor protein p53 is a key event for cells in response to DNA damage
                                                      [29]. Most of chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment work through DNA damage,
                                                      resulting in cell death by apoptosis, autophapy or necrosis [30]. For apoptosis, both extrinsic
                                                      and intrinsic pathways lead to CASPASE 3 activation which eventually induces apoptosis, and
                                                      therefore cleaved CASPASE 3 can be used to evaluate the apoptosis process [31]. For autop-

                                                      autophagy and autophagy-related processes, including autophagic cell death [32]. In this study,

                                              hours culture by changing media, and 48 hours, respectively (Fig 2A). The expression and loca-

                                              were cultured for another 24 hours or not (Fig 2B–2D). When treated for 48 hours, although
                                              p53 was not shown in cells, the cell number was significantly reduced, which indicated those
                                              cells expressing p53 were probably dead from DNA damage (Fig 2E). Also, the expressions of
                                              cleaved CASPASE 3 and LC3 were higher in Malformin C treated Colon 38 cells, especially at
                                              the concentration of 0.54 μM, which signified there were more cells experiencing apoptosis and
                                              autophagy after being exposed to Malformin C (Fig 2B–2E).

                                             116 cells were treated with Malformin C for 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours, and the
                                             expressions of phospho-Histone H2A.X and total H2A.X were examined by Western blot. As
                                             shown in Fig 3, there was a dose-dependent up-regulated expression of phosphorylated H2A.X
                                             at Ser139 after 24-hour treatment of Malformin C in both Colon 38 and HCT 116 cells, while

                                                the expression of total H2A.X increased only in Colon 38 cells after 24-hour treatment of Mal-
                                                formin C. Also, a minor dose-dependent increase of phospho-H2A.X expression was observed
                                                after 8-hour treatment of Malformin C in HCT 116 cells. When we took the ratio between
                                                phosphorylated and total H2A.X, it indicated that Malformin C caused the phosphorylation of
                                                H2A.X in HCT 116 cells in a dose-dependent manner when treated for 8–24 hours.
                                                   The expression of CASPASE 3 and LC3 was also examined by Western blot. During autop-
                                                hagy, LC3AI is converted to LC3AII through lipidation, and LC3AII serves as an indicator of
                                                autophagy. So we analyzed LC3AII expression to test Malformin C’s effect on autophagy. After
                                                24-hour treatment of Malformin C, we observed a dose-dependent up-regulation of cleaved
                                                CASPASE 3 in HCT 116 cells, and a dose-dependent up-regulation of LC3AII in both Colon
                                                38 and HCT 116 cells (Fig 4A and 4B). But there was no dose-response for the increased

hours was tested by Western blot, with β-Actin expression as an internal control. During autophagy process, LC3AI will be converted into LC3AII to be
functional, so we analyzed LC3AII expression for autophagy process. (C) Malformin C led to late apoptosis and necrosis after 24-hour treatment examined by
apoptosis assay. Untreated or Malformin C-treated Colon 38 cells (2×106) were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 annexin V and PI and processed by flow
cytometer. The percentage of early apoptotic population (lower right panel), late apoptotic population (upper right panel) and necrotic population (upper left
panels) is shown in the graph. CPT, a known apoptosis-inducing agent, was used as a control. Three independent experiments were performed with
duplicates for each condition, and one typical result is shown here.

                                        expression of cleaved CASPASE 3 in Colon 38 cells, and it could due to the fact that some apo-
                                        ptotic cells detached from the plate during culture and were lost when the media was removed.
                                        No significant changes of cleaved CASPASE 3 and LC3AII expression were detected after
                                        4-hour and 8-hour treatment (S5 Fig). To further investigate the death process of those DNA-
                                        damaged cells, we conducted the apoptosis assay and found a significantly larger group of late
                                        apoptotic cells and necrotic cells after Malformin C exposure, while the percentage of early
                                        apoptotic cells showed no difference from the control (Fig 3E). All in all, we found that
                                        24-hour treatment of Malformin C could cause DNA damage and lead to cell death through
                                        apoptosis, autophapy and necrosis.


                                        Pathological investigation on Malformin C treated mice
                                        In order to study the toxicity of Malformin C itself, six 9±0.5 week old BDF-1 mice were ran-
                                        domly assigned to control group and 1.8mg/kg Malformin C group with three mice in each.
                                        Prior to death (about 6 hours after injection), all three mice in the treated cage exhibited
                                        hunched posture, huddling, reluctance to move and piloerection (Fig 5A). Conversely, all three
                                        mice in the control group were active with a smooth haircoat (Fig 5B). No significant gross
                                        lesions were noted in any of the six mice upon post-mortem examination. Clinical chemistry
                                        panels on the treated mice indicated marked elevation in AST and a mild increase in ALT (Fig
                                        5C and 5D, S2 Table), consistent with acute hepatocellular damage. Histologically, all the tis-
                                        sues were stained and the only finding in the treated mice was in the liver and consisted of
                                        Kupffer cell activation, mild infiltration by neutrophils and occasional hepatocellular apoptosis.
                                        While these changes are suggestive of and consistent with that expected in an acute inflamma-
                                        tory response, they are subtle. Clinical signs prior to death did not support a cardiac or neuro-
                                        logic phenotype and there were no gross or histologic lesions within the heart or brain of any
                                        of these mice. Culture of the abdominal cavity and spleen of the three treated mice, as well as
                                        one control mouse, did not yield bacterial growth. The small micro-granulomas noted in all
                                        mice are considered to be a chronic lesion and not associated with the given compound. Addi-
                                        tionally, data from the following study of Colon 38 bearing mice showed a noted dose-depen-
                                        dent elevation of IL-6 in Malformin C injected groups, which also indicates the existence of
                                        acute inflammation cause by Malformin C (Fig 5F). In this study, significant increase of TNF
                                        in tumor-bearing model was not observed (Fig 5G).


                                        Malformin C’s anti-cancer effects and its in vivo toxicity
                                        Malformin C was reported to be toxic in vivo 0.9mg/kg for newborn rats, but original data wer-
                                        en’t available nor were there any follow-up studies. In our preliminary study, Malformin C was
                                        delivered i.p., and all the mice (both 7 and 9 weeks old when treated) in 1.8mg/kg and 2.6mg/kg
                                        groups died. For 7-week old mice, three out of four of the mice in 0.9mg/ml group died within
                                        24 hours (Fig 6A), while there was no mouse death in 0.9mg/ml group when they were treated at
                                        9 weeks old (Fig 6D). All the mice deaths were unexpected and caused by the acute toxicity of
                                        Malformin C. In order to confirm that the cause of death was age related, we conducted the sec-
                                        ond injection when the mice were 8 weeks old and 9 weeks old, using the mice that were origi-
                                        nally given 0.3mg/kg qw (Fig 6B). No mouse death was observed this time. Again, 9-week old
                                        mice didn’t die in Malformin C 0.9mg/ml group in our following study (Fig 6D). Therefore, for
                                        9-week old mice 0.9mg/kg was their highest dosage limit for treatment, the cause of death at
                                        0.9mg/kg might be related to mouse maturity, and significant acute toxicity occurred within 24
                                        hours in mice treated with Malformin C and there was no obvious accumulating effect since all
                                        the mice in 0.3mg/kg q.o.d. group survived.

exhibited hunched posture, huddling and piloerection. (B) Control mice injected with PBS were active, with normal haircoats. (C) The parameter indicating
the most different between treated and control mice was AST (aspartate aminotransferase). AST elevation may be lower than reported due to a hemolysis
3+, but is still abnormal. (D) There were also mild differences in ALT (alanine amino transferase) values between treated and control mice. (E) ALP (alkaline
phosphatase) could be elevated with cholestasis, but in this case, the average value for the treated and control mice was identical, and thus not considered to
be a significant finding. (F) Mouse IL-6 level in the plasma of Colon 38 bearing BDF-1 mice. The left graph showed a dose dependent increase of mouse IL-6
in the plasma 6 hours after 0.9mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg and 0.1mg/kg Malformin C injection compared to PBS group, while the right graph showed similar effects 4
hours after 0.9mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg Malformin C injection. (G) Mouse TNF level in the plasma of Colon 38 bearing BDF-1 mice. No significant changes were
shown either 6 hours or 4 hours before and after different concentrations of Malformin C injection compared to PBS injection group.

                                                   The anti-tumor effect of Malformin C was measured by the volume of transplanted Colon
                                                38 tumor in BDF-1 mice, while body weight loss was recorded as a primary indicator of side
                                                effects. As we could see from Fig 5B, the tumor of the only 7-week old mouse which survived
                                                0.9mg/kg Malformin C injection did not grow until Day 15. But when treated at 9 weeks old,
                                                the tumors in 0.9mg/kg group grew up to 2.7-fold of the original size on Day 9 (Fig 6D). There
                                                was no significant difference between 0.3mg/kg q.w. and 0.3mg/kg q.o.d.(Fig 6B), and no sig-
                                                nificant difference between 0.9mg/kg q.w. and 0.3mg/kg q.w. (Fig 6D). Therefore, we suggest
                                                that Malformin C’s anti-tumor effect might be related to its age and in vivo toxicity, and
                                                0.3mg/kg q.w. was the best therapeutic dosage. As for the body weight changes of Colon 38
                                                bearing BDF-1 mice (Fig 6C and 6E), there was up to 9% weight loss one or two days after

group and the week age indicated was that at the beginning of the experiment. One of the mice in 0.9mg/kg qw 7-week old group died by accident and was
therefore excluded from the graph. Malformin C was given by i.p., qw means every week, qod means every other day. (B) Tumor growth of Colon 38 bearing

                                        Malformin C injection, and the growth of tumor was the major reason for weight loss aside
                                        from Malformin C’s toxicity. Also we found that the weight loss in 0.9mg/kg group was more
                                        obvious than that in 0.3mg/kg group, while it took a longer time for mice in 0.9mg/kg group to
                                        recover as well.

                                        patients. Multidrug resistance is one major obstacle to the anti-tumor effect. P-glycoprotein
                                        (P-gp), also known as ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1), is an ATP-
                                        dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds which often leads to multi-drug resis-
                                        tance to anti-cancer drugs. It is extensively distributed and expressed in the intestinal epithe-
                                        lium, hepatocytes, renal proximal tubular cells, adrenal gland and capillary endothelial cells
                                        comprising the blood-brain and blood-testis barrier. According to our study, Malformin C is
                                        highly resistant to P-gp over-expressed cell lines and this resistance is further confirmed by the
                                        reversal effect of P-gp antagonist. This means that, first of all, Malformin C’s effect will be com-
                                        promised if taken orally since there is vast MDR protein in GI tract. Therefore, we choose
                                        intra-peritoneal injection for in vivo study. Secondly, acute toxicity in vivo is less likely due to
                                        Central Nervous System (CNS) damage because there is also abundant MDR protein in the
                                        blood-brain barrier. However, Malformin C is not resistant to all drug-resistant cell lines. It is
                                        actually more sensitive to CPT resistant cell line, which suggests combined Malformin C and
                                        CPT-11 for colon cancer research.
                                            Our experiments indicate that Malformin C exhibits a potent cell growth inhibition against
                                        colon cancer cell lines possibly by inducing DNA damage, phosphorylating H2A.X, perturbing
                                        cell cycle progression and consequently leading to multiple forms of cell death. A transcription
                                        factor and tumor suppressor protein, p53, is a sensor of DNA damage, and plays a pivotal role
                                        in growth arrest and apoptosis. The activation of p53 can trigger cell cycle arrest both in G1
                                        and G2/M phases, and traditionally many DNA-damage-inducing therapeutic drugs, including
                                        CPT, target tumors via p53-mediated apoptosis [34–36]. As is presented here, Malformin C
                                        up-regulates the expression of p53 and results in G2/M arrest in Colon 38 cells at 0.5–0.8μM.
                                        Furthermore, 24-hour treatment with Malformin C induces multiple forms of cell death
                                        through apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis in different colon cancer cell lines according to
                                        immunofluorescence micrographs, Western blot and apoptosis assay. In addition, Malformin
                                        C is reported to inhibit Bleomycin-induced G2 checkpoint in Jurkat cells with an IC50 of
                                        0.9nM [14]. However, no similar G2 checkpoint inhibition is shown for SN38-induced G2/M
                                        arrest when treated with low concentration of Malformin C in Colon 38 cells. The difference
                                        may be because Jurkat cells lack functional p53 and could only repair DNA in G2 checkpoint
                                        but Colon 38 cells can repair in both G1 and G2 checkpoints.
                                            Malformin C is claimed to have anti-cancer activity in recent publications, but this is the
                                        first time that Malformin C’s in vivo anti-cancer effects have been reported. We carried out a
                                        series of animal studies to investigate the lethal dosage and therapeutic dosage, anti-tumor
                                        effect and toxicity, as well as age effects. Firstly, Malformin C injection of 0.1mg/kg every
                                        other day has no anti-tumor effect yet has a high resistant risk, whereas 0.9mg/kg per week
                                        Malformin C either causes fatal toxicity in 7-week old mice or has no advantage compared to
                                        0.3mg/kg per week dosage in 9-week old mice. Therefore, Malformin C injection at 0.3mg/kg
                                        per week is the best therapeutic dosage, at which tumor size is effectively inhibited yet toxicity
                                        is well tolerated. The therapeutic index of Malformin C, however, is too low to be an anti-can-
                                        cer drug. Considering this, new analogs of Malformin C will be synthesized and analyzed in the
                                        hope of separating its toxicity and anti-tumor effect. Secondly, age plays an important role in

                                        this study. This phenomenon is clearly illustrated in 0.9mg/kg per week Malformin C group in
                                        that the anti-tumor effect and in vivo toxicity of this compound is notably dependent on the
                                        week-age of the mice on treatment day. This implies the microenvironment inside the mouse
                                        especially those related to maturity, instead of the tumor factor itself, is critical for Malformin
                                        C’s function. Additionally, Malformin C is a two-edged weapon for body weight changes. On
                                        one hand, it restricts the tumor size and to some extent prevents weight loss from cancer
                                        cachexia. On the other hand, its acute toxicity also causes weight loss. Finally, an initial patho-
                                        logical experiment helps us to look into the reason for the acute toxicity of Malformin C. An
                                        acute yet subtle inflammatory response has been proven after Malformin C administration.
                                        Evidence does not support a cardiac or cerebral cause of death. In future study, lower dosage of
                                        the Malformin C will be tested to allow more time for lesion development, in order to further
                                        investigate its toxicology.
                                           In summary, we report that Malformin C, a toxic fungal cyclic pentapeptide, is active
                                        against different cancer cells including Colon 38 in vitro through multiple mechanisms. How-
                                        ever, its in vivo anti-tumor effects is largely restricted by the acute lethal toxicity, which is
                                        closely related to the maturity of the mice. In our future work, we will synthesize new analogs
                                        of Malformin C to explore the structure activity relationship, as well as to investigate their
                                        effects on the tumor and the microenvironment inside the body. The hematological effects and
                                        cytokine changes caused by this unique compound will also be addressed in order to tap the
                                        potential of clinical use in cancer treatment.
