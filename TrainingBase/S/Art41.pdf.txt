                Abstract
                The de novo synthesis of myo-inositol occurs via a two-step process: ﬁrst, glucose 6-phosphate is
                converted into inositol 1-phosphate by an INO1 (myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase; EC 5.5.1.4); then,
                it is dephosphorylated by an inositol monophosphatase. The myo-inositol can then be incorporated into PI
                (phosphatidylinositol), which is utilized in a variety of cellular functions, including the biosynthesis of GPI
                (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchors. A putative INO1 was identiﬁed in the Trypanosoma brucei genome
                database and, by recombinant expression in Escherichia coli, was shown to be a catalytically active INO1.
                To investigate the importance of INO1, we created a conditional knockout, which, under non-permissive
                conditions, showed that INO1 is an essential gene in bloodstream form T. brucei and that the de novo
                synthesized myo-inositol is used for the formation of PI and GPI anchors.
