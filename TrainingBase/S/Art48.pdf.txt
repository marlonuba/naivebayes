                                                             ABSTRACT

Suppression by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of the expression of a target gene is known as RNA interfer-
ence (RNAi). No quantitative analysis of the effects of RNAi on the expression of specific genes in cultured
plant cells has been reported. However, as it is possible to produce populations of cultured plant cells that are
uniform and divide synchronously for functional analysis of genes of interest, we performed a quantitative
study of the effects of RNAi in such cells. We constructed dsRNA expression plasmids for a luciferase gene un-
der the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter by simply connecting sense and antisense
sequences in a head-to-head manner. An RNAi effect was observed 24 hours after the introduction of dsRNA
expression plasmids into tobacco BY-2 cells by electroporation. The simple system for suppression of specific
genes in plant cells should be useful in attempts to elucidate the roles of individual genes in plant cells.

FIG. 4. Comparison of the RNAi effect of dsRNA on firefly luciferase activity with the effects on this activity of sense and antisense sequences
in BY-2 cells. (A) Tobacco BY-2 cells were converted to protoplasts and cotransformed by electroporation with three plasmids, namely, 0.3 mg of
p35Sluc, 0.3 mg of p35SRluc, and 3 mg of a sense, antisense, or dsRNA expression plasmid or 3 mg of a control plasmid (p35SDsRed). The amount
of each expression plasmid used for electroporation was 10 times that of the reporter genes. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized by ref-
erence to the activity of Renilla luciferase. (B) The activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases used to calculate the results in A. Triplicate electro-
poration experiments were performed in every case. Columns and bars show mean results and SD, respectively.

                                                                      dsRNA targeted to a gene for firefly luciferase and demon-
   We constructed two dsRNA expression plasmids under the             strated clearly that RNAi can be used to suppress gene expres-
control of the 35S promoter of CaMV, targeted to the firefly lu-
ciferase gene (Fig. 2A,B). The length of the antisense sequence,
which was defined as the length of the double-stranded region,
was approximately 500 bp and 300 bp, respectively. The sense
strand in each dsRNA expression plasmid was the region that
corresponded to nucleotides 11 to 1586 relative to the site for
initiation of translation of the luciferase gene. The spacer region
between the sense and the antisense strand was designed to
form a loop within a putative hairpin structure. In both cases,
the spacer was the same 86 bp and corresponded to nt 1500 to
1586. It is known that a perfect palindromic sequence without
a loop sequence cannot survive in E. coli because of frequent
recombination (Leach, 1994). Therefore, we used E. coli SURE
II (see Materials and Methods), in which the palindromic se-
quences are more stable than in other strains (Tavernarakis et
al., 2000). In fact, even with the spacer (loop) region, dsRNA
expression plasmids were somewhat difficult to construct, and
odd products with, for example, duplicates of plasmids were of-
ten detected (data not shown). The stability of plasmids seemed
to be affected by the length of the double-stranded region.

Estimation of specific dsRNA-mediated suppression as
compared with sense and antisense effects
   We first examined whether the RNAi effect was due to the

significant enhancement of the RNAi effect (Fig. 5). In our sys-                        ACKNOWLEDGMENT
