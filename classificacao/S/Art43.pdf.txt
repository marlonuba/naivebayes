Abstract
   In this study, we report the ultrastructural and growth alterations caused by cysteine peptidase inhibitors on the plant trypanosomatid
Phytomonas serpens. We showed that the cysteine peptidase inhibitors at 10 mM were able to arrest cellular growth as well as promote alterations
in the cell morphology, including the parasites becoming short and round. Additionally, iodoacetamide induced ultrastructural alterations, such as
disintegration of cytoplasmic organelles, swelling of the nucleus and kinetoplast–mitochondrion complex, which culminated in parasite death.
Leupeptin and antipain induced the appearance of microvillar extensions and blebs on the cytoplasmic membrane, resembling a shedding process.
A 40 kDa cysteine peptidase was detected in hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases of P. serpens cells after Triton X-114 extraction. Additionally,
we have shown through immunoblotting that anti-cruzipain polyclonal antibodies recognised two major polypeptides in P. serpens, including a
40 kDa component. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that this cruzipain-like protein has a location on the cell surface. Ultrastructural
immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of the cruzipain-like protein on the surface and in small membrane fragments released
from leupeptin-treated parasites. Furthermore, the involvement of cysteine peptidases of P. serpens in the interaction with explanted salivary
glands of the phytophagous insect Oncopeltus fasciatus was also investigated. When P. serpens cells were pre-treated with either cysteine
peptidase inhibitors or anti-cruzipain antibody, a significant reduction of the interaction process was observed. Collectively, these results suggest
that cysteine peptidases participate in several biological processes in P. serpens including cell growth and interaction with the invertebrate vector.
