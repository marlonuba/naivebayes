SUMMARY
Oncogenic transcription factor FOXM1
is overexpressed in the majority of human
cancers and it is a potential target for anticancer
therapy. We identified proteasome inhibitors as
the first type of drugs that target FOXM1 in
cancer cells. Here, we found that HSP90
inhibitor PF-4942847 and heat shock also
suppress FOXM1. The common effector, which
was induced after treatment with proteasome
and HSP90 inhibitors or heat-shock, was the
molecular chaperone HSP70. We show that
HSP70 binds to FOXM1 following proteotoxic
stress and that HSP70 inhibits FOXM1 DNAbinding
ability. Inhibition of FOXM1
transcriptional auto-regulation by HSP70 leads
to the suppression of FOXM1 protein
expression. In addition, HSP70 suppression
elevates FOXM1 expression and simultaneous
inhibition of FOXM1 and HSP70 increases the
sensitivity of human cancer cells to anticancer
drug-induced apoptosis. Overall, we determined
the unique and novel mechanism of FOXM1
suppression by proteasome inhibitors.
Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) is an
oncogenic transcription factor that is also a wellrecognized
cell cycle regulator [1]. FOXM1
expression is eliminated from quiescent or
differentiated cells, but it is highly expressed in
proliferating and malignant cells [1]. It is also
well documented that FOXM1 is overexpressed
in broad types of human cancers and it
contributes to several aspects of cancer
development [2,3]. Consequently, it is not
surprising that FOXM1 has evolved as a
potential target of anticancer therapy [4].
Our group identified the thiazole
antibiotics Siomycin A [5] and thiostrepton [6]
as the first chemical inhibitors of FOXM1.
Investigation of their mechanism of action
revealed that they are proteasome inhibitors [7].
Bona fide proteasome inhibitors including
MG132 and bortezomib were also found to
hinder the transcriptional activity and expression
of FOXM1 [7], suggesting that FOXM1 is one
of the general targets of these drugs.
Proteasome inhibitors stabilize the expression of cellular proteins; therefore suppression of
FOXM1 is counterintuitive and has not been
well understood. As an explanation for this
effect, we put forward the hypothesis that a
negative regulator of FOXM1 (NRFM) is
stabilized by proteasome inhibitors [8], which
directly or indirectly inhibits FOXM1
transcriptional activity [9]. Here, we determined
that the NRFM is HSP70. Because a positive
auto-regulation loop is required for FOXM1
expression [9], HSP70 (NRFM) also represses
FOXM1 mRNA and protein expression after
treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are stress
proteins, which are mainly expressed in response
to different cellular and environmental insults.
HSPs are divided by their molecular weight into
the subfamilies of HSP110, HSP90, HSP70,
HSP60 and small HSPs. Besides their major
function of aiding protein folding as molecular
chaperons, HSPs also play important roles in
cell signaling, protein trafficking and blocking
cell death [10,11,12,13]. Elevated levels of
HSPs are linked not only to cytoprotection but to
neurodegenerative disorders and cancer [10,12].
Among the several members of the HSP70
family, HSC70 is constitutively expressed under
non-stressful conditions as well, while the
expression of stress-inducible HSP70 is mainly
detectable following different types of stress
[11,12]. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic
HSP70 is often seen in human cancers; therefore
targeting HSP70 has emerged as a tempting
approach to improve anticancer therapy [12].
However, our current findings suggest that
caution should be employed with the
incorporation of HSP70 inhibitors into
chemotherapeutic cocktails for the treatment of
cancer because they lead to the induction of
oncogenic transcription factor FOXM1.
In this study, we identified HSP70 as the
negative regulator of FOXM1 after proteotoxic
stress. We demonstrate that treatment with
proteasome and HSP90 inhibitors or heat shock
results in decreased FOXM1 and increased
HSP70 protein expression. We also show that
following proteotoxic stress FOXM1 and HSP70
bind to each other. We concluded that HSP70
negatively regulates the transcriptional activity
of FOXM1 by interfering with the DNA-binding ability of FOXM1. Because of FOXM1 autoregulation,
HSP70 also inhibits FOXM1
expression. In addition, we demonstrate that
combination of FOXM1 and HSP70 inhibitors
increases the sensitivity of human cancer cells to
cell death. Our results reveal a novel regulatory
function of HSP70 after proteotoxic stress.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell culture and chemical compounds
DU145 prostate, MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer
cell lines (ATCC), U2OS osteosarcoma and
osteosarcoma-derived C3 [14] and C3-luc cells
[5] were grown in DMEM medium (Cellgro).
MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) breast and RPMI 8266
multiple myeloma cancer cell lines were grown
in RPMI medium (Cellgro). The media were
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin
(GIBCO). All the cells were
maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2. Bortezomib
(Velcade; Millenium Pharmaceuticals),
thiostrepton (Sigma), PF-4942847 (Pfizer), 9-
Aminoacridine (9-AA, Fluka) and Quercetin
(Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (Fisher Scientific), and Doxycycline
(D5897; LKT Laboratories) in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS).
Immunoblot analysis
Treated cells were harvested and lysed by using
IP buffer (20mM HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 150
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 100mM
NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 0.2 mM PMSF supplemented
with protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied
Sciences)). Protein concentration was
determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (BIORAD).
Isolated proteins were separated on
SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Millipore). Immunoblotting was carried out
with antibodies specific for FOXM1 (Santa Cruz
and also the rabbit polyclonal antibody against
FOXM1 was described previously [15]), HSP70
3a3 and 2A4 (kind gifts from Dr. Morimoto),
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell signaling), and ?-actin
(Sigma).
Plasmids, siRNAs and transfection. FOXM1
expression plasmid was a kind gift of the late
Dr. Robert H. Costa and the HSP70 expression plasmid was purchased from Addgene (Addgene
plasmid 15215; [16]). Control (universal
negative control #1) small interfering RNA
(siRNA) and siRNAs specific to HSP70
[17,18,19] and FOXM1
(GGACCACUUUCCCUACUUUUU) were
synthesized by Sigma. Transient transfections
were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation. Cells were processed as
described in the figure legends after transfection.
Immunoprecipitation (IP)
Cells were harvested, lysed in IP buffer
supplemented with protease inhibitors and
protein concentration was determined by the
Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent (BIO-RAD).
Two-Four hundred µg of the lysates in 500 µl
volume were pre-cleared by incubating with 1
µg of rabbit IgG and 30 µl of protein-A-agarose
(Santa Cruz) on a rotary mixer for 30 minutes at
4ºC. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at
1000 rpm and the clarified lysates were
transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes. Onetwo
µg of FOXM1 antibody and 30 µl of
protein-A-agarose were added and the samples
were incubated on a rotary mixer overnight at
4ºC. The agarose beads were washed 4 times
with IP buffer containing protease inhibitors and
centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rpm at 4ºC each
time. The beads were then resuspended in 100
µl 2X Laemmli sample buffer (BIO-RAD),
boiled, centrifuged and the supernatant was
separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and
immunoblotted with FOXM1 and HSP70
specific antibodies.
Flow cytometry - Propidium Iodide staining
Cells were treated as indicated and harvested by
trypsinization. Then, cells were washed in PBS
and fixed in ice-cold 95% ethanol. Following
fixation, cells were stained with propidium
iodide (50 µg/ml) (Invitrogen) in PBS/RNAse
A/Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at room
temperature and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was
performed as described in [20], with the
following modifications. A total of 8x10^6
U2OS-derived C3 cells were used per IP; input corresponded to 1/50 part of the IP. Five ug
FOXM1 antibody (Santa Cruz) was bound to 30
µl of Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) and
added to each IP. The amount of DNA from the
IP and from input in PCR reaction corresponded
to 500 pg/ul. qPCR reactions contained 2.5µl of
the SYBR Green mix (Bio-Rad), 1.25µl of 4µM
primer pair mix and 1.25µl the DNA template.
The following primers were used to amplify the
indicated human gene promoter fragments:

AGATGGCTGGTGTTCCAATGTAGC-3`, and
AURKB-reverse 5`-
TTCTTTCCGTTGCTCAGACTCCCA-3`;

The qPCR was run on the Bio-Rad CFX
thermocycler using the following qPCR
protocol: 1) 98°C for 1:30min.; 2) 98°C for 10s;
3) 60°C for 1min.; 4) 72°C for 30s; 5) cycle 39
times steps 2-4; 6) 95°C for 30s; 7) Melt Curve
55°C to 95°C in 0.5°C increments for 30s.
Baseline threshold was manually set up to 15.90
for each plate. Enrichment was calculated using
the 2-??Ct method and results are presented as
% of input.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using oneway
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple
comparison post test or unpaired t-test. P values
of <0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant. FOXM1 protein expression is suppressed,
while HSP70 protein expression is elevated
following proteotoxic stress
Previously, we found that FOXM1 is
down-regulated [7], whereas it is known that
HSP70 is up-regulated after treatment with
proteasome inhibitors [21]. In order to confirm
this observation, multiple myeloma (RPMI
8266) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231)
were treated with proteasome inhibitors
bortezomib or thiostrepton (Fig. 1A-C). We
found that following treatment with proteasome
inhibitors FOXM1 suppression correlated with
HSP70 up-regulation. Because inhibition of
HSP90 leads to the up-regulation of HSP70 [12],
we wanted to determine if treatment with HSP90
inhibitors also represses FOXM1. MIA PaCa-2
pancreatic and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells were treated with the HSP90 inhibitor PF-
4942847 and FOXM1 was detected by
immunoblotting (Fig. 1D, E). We found that a
decrease in FOXM1 expression indeed linked to
an increase in HSP70 expression following
treatment with HSP90 inhibitor PF-4942847. In
agreement with previous studies we also
confirmed that HSP90 inhibitor PF-4942847 is
not a proteasome inhibitor (data not shown),
thereby it induces HSP70 (Fig 1D, E) by a
different mechanism from proteasome inhibitors.
Because both proteasome inhibitors and HSP90
inhibitor PF-4942847 up-regulated HSP70 and
suppressed FOXM1, it suggests that after
proteotoxic stress the down-regulation of
FOXM1 by HSP70 is a universal mechanism.
Additionally, when breast (MDA-MB-231)
cancer cells were subjected to heat shock we
also observed that the induction of HSP70
correlated with the suppression of FOXM1 (Fig.
1F). These data suggest that HSP70 might
negatively regulate FOXM1 during proteotoxic
stress.
Inhibition of HSP70 alleviates FOXM1
suppression during proteotoxic stress
To evaluate the role of HSP70 in the
negative regulation of FOXM1 during
proteotoxic stress we inhibited HSP70 using
drugs and RNA interference (RNAi). Prostate
(DU145), breast (MDA-MB-231) and
osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells were treated with
thiostrepton or PF-4942847 in the presence and absence of HSP70 inhibitors 9AA or quercetin,
which are commonly used to inhibit HSP70
[10,11,12,24]. Western blotting showed that
inhibition of HSP70 led to the restoration of
FOXM1 protein level to basal level following
treatment with proteasome inhibitor thiostrepton
or HSP90 inhibitor PF-4942847 (Fig. 2A-D).
Because both 9AA and quercetin are not specific
inhibitors of HSP70 we also utilized RNAi
against HSP70. Similarly to the
pharmacological inhibitors of HSP70, RNAimediated
knockdown of HSP70 in pancreatic
and breast cancer cells restored the protein
expression of FOXM1 after thiostrepton or PF-
4942847 treatment (Fig. 2E-G). These data
suggest that HSP70 suppresses FOXM1 during
proteotoxic stress.
Inhibition of HSP70 in combination with
suppression of FOXM1 promotes apoptosis of
human cancer cells
HSP70 can block both the extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathway at different levels.
Consequently, inhibition of HSP70 is believed
to counteract its anti-apoptotic functions and
make cells more sensitive to cell death
[10,11,12]. However, according to our current
findings HSP70 inhibition leads to the
upregulation of FOXM1 (Fig. 2). FOXM1 is
also known to confer resistance to apoptosis
induced by various drugs including proteasome
inhibitors, Herceptin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and
epirubicin [25,26,27,28]. Consequently,
FOXM1 suppression increased the sensitivity of
cancer cells to different cell death-inducing
stimuli [3,4].
We were interested whether concurrent
inhibition of FOXM1 and HSP70 make cancer
cells more prone to cell death. Transient
FOXM1 knockdown cells were treated with
thiostrepton in the presence or absence of
HSP70 inhibitor 9AA. Apoptosis was assessed
by immunoblotting for cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.
3A-C) and by flow cytometry after propidium
iodide staining (Fig. 3D). In agreement with
earlier studies [10,11,12], we also observed that
HSP70 inhibition sensitized cancer cells to cell
death, in this case to thiostrepton-mediated
apoptosis. But cancer cells with FOXM1
knockdown in the presence of HSP70 inhibitor
9AA were more sensitive to cell death induced by thiostrepton (Fig. 3). These data suggest that
simultaneous suppression of FOXM1 and
HSP70 could be greatly beneficial for cancer
treatment in order to circumvent any drugrelated
resistance.
FOXM1 and HSP70 interact with each other
following proteotoxic stress
Because treatment with both
thiostrepton and heat shock resulted in low level
of endogenous FOXM1 protein (Fig. 1) we took
advantage of the tetracycline/doxycyclineinducible
system to obtain high levels of
exogenous FOXM1 [5], which is not affected by
either stressor (data not shown). U2OS
osteosarcoma derived, tetracycline/doxycyclineinducible
C3 cells [14] were treated with
doxycycline and thiostrepton, and
immunoprecipitated with FOXM1 specific
antibody. Analysis of the TCA-acetone purified
immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry
suggested that FOXM1 interacts with HSP70
(data not shown).
In order to further confirm the binding
between FOXM1 and HSP70, the U2OS-C3
[14] and U2OS-C3-luc cell lines [5] were treated
with doxycycline and proteasome inhibitor
thiostrepton (Fig. 4A) or heat shock (Fig. 4B),
respectively. Immunoprecipitations were
performed with FOXM1 specific antibody
followed by immunoblotting for FOXM1 and
HSP70. HSP70 co-immunoprecipitated with
FOXM1 in both thiostrepton and heat shock
treated cells (Fig. 4A, B).
HSP70 inhibits DNA-binding of FOXM1 to
its own regulatory elements
In preliminary experiments, HSP70
inhibited transactivation of specific reporter by
exogenous FOXM1 (data not shown). Because
FOXM1 is involved in a positive auto-regulatory
loop wherein it induces its own transcription,
inhibition of FOXM1 transcriptional activity
also leads to the downregulation of its mRNA
and protein levels [5,9]. Next, we investigated
the mechanism by which HSP70 inhibits the
transcriptional activity of FOXM1. Chromatin
Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed to determine whether HSP70
interferes with the binding of FOXM1 to its own
regulatory elements and to the Cdc25B target gene promoter. A promoter region outside of
the FOXM1 binding site of direct transcriptional
target Aurora B kinase was used as the negative
control. The C3 cell line with stable expression
of the doxycycline-inducible FOXM1-GFP
fusion protein [14] was transiently transfected
with the control EGFP and the HSP70
expression plasmids. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, FOXM1 expression was increased
by doxycycline addition for twenty-four hours,
after which cells were processed for ChIP.
These quantitative ChIP assays revealed that
HSP70 reduces up to 2-fold the ability of
FOXM1 to bind to its regulatory elements (Fig.
4D), while the levels of exogenous FOXM1 was
not affected (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that
HSP70 interacts with FOXM1 and inhibits its
DNA-binding activity.
DISCUSSION
The oncogenic transcription factor
FOXM1 is one of the most overexpressed genes
in cancer [29], and it contributes to several
aspects of oncogenesis [3] including metastasis
in pancreatic [30] and liver cancer [31].
Therapeutic targeting of FOXM1 is widely
discussed in the literature and a few years ago
we identified proteasome inhibitors as the first
chemical inhibitors of FOXM1 [5,7]. However,
the mechanisms of FOXM1 suppression by
proteasome inhibitors were not well understood.
We previously proposed a hypothetical model
for the suppression of FOXM1 by proteasome
inhibitors: proteasome inhibitors stabilize a
negative regulator of FOXM1 (NRFM), which
in turn inhibits the activity of FOXM1 as a
transcription factor [8,32]. In this study, we
identified the molecular chaperon HSP70 as the
NRFM after proteotoxic stress (Fig. 4E). We
determined that increased HSP70 protein
expression correlates with decreased FOXM1
protein expression after exposure to proteotoxic
stress (Fig. 1) and that inhibition of HSP70 upregulates
FOXM1 expression (Fig. 2). We
demonstrated that HSP70 binds to FOXM1 (Fig
4A, B) and it inhibits FOXM1 DNA-binding to
its promoter elements (Fig. 4D). As we have
shown before, FOXM1 is involved in a positive
feedback loop and activates its own transcription
[9], so inhibition of FOXM1 transcriptional
activity by HSP70 also leads to a decrease in its expression after proteotoxic stress (Fig 1, Fig.
4E). Recently, Cheng and colleagues confirmed
the importance of FOXM1 auto-regulation for
cancer development [33,34]. They showed that
tumor suppressor SPDEF competed with
FOXM1 for the FOXM1 binding site
responsible for the auto-regulation of FOXM1.
Furthermore, SPDEF inhibited FOXM1
expression and consequently cancer
development in a mouse model of prostate
cancer [33]. These data suggest that the autoregulation
of FOXM1 might be required for
cancer development and could be a promising
target for anticancer treatment.
Suppression of FOXM1 [22] and
accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates [35] are
two of the accepted hallmarks of proteasome
inhibition. Here, we confirm that HSP90
inhibitors are not proteasome inhibitors because
they do not induce the accumulation of ubiquitin
conjugates (data not shown). However, they
target FOXM1 (Fig. 1D, E) suggesting that they
belong to a novel class of FOXM1 inhibitors.
Both proteasome and HSP90 inhibitors upregulate
HSP70 and suppress FOXM1,
supporting the idea that HSP70 is the universal
NRFM that inhibits FOXM1 after proteotoxic
stress.
Under normal conditions, HSP70
accumulates after stress in order to protect cells
from the adverse effects thus promoting cell
survival. However, high levels of HSP70 are
also often found in different types of cancer
thereby providing protection against cell death
and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.
Therefore, HSP70 appeared as one of the
important targets to improve the outcomes of
anticancer therapy and the search for inhibitors
of HSP70 has been on the rise [12]. However,
our current work calls for caution in respect to
the prospective administration of HSP70
inhibitors to cancer patients in the future. We
showed that inhibition of HSP70 leads to the upregulation
of oncogenic transcription factor
FOXM1 (Fig. 2) and that FOXM1 knockdown
cancer cells in the presence of HSP70 inhibitor
9AA became more sensitive to apoptosis (Fig.
3). Consequently, our current findings strongly
support the combination of novel types of
FOXM1 and HSP70 inhibitors in order to avoid
detrimental effects and to achieve a more effective therapeutic strategy for the successful
treatment of cancer.
Several parallels exist between FOXM1
and HSP70: (a) both are overexpressed and
considered oncogenic in different types of
cancer and their elevated expression is
associated with poor prognosis for cancer
patients; (b) increased expression of both make
cancer cells resistant to cell death and
chemotherapeutic drugs; (c) both have emerged
as attractive targets of anticancer therapy
[3,4,12,36]. Altogether, according to the
existing literature data both FOXM1 and HSP70 are oncogenes. Also, authors of a recent review
on HSP70 argued that HSP70 might contribute
to cancer development by regulating multiple
signaling pathways such as HIF1-alpha and NFkB
[36]. However, according to our findings by
inhibiting the FOXM1 oncogene, HSP70 also
can act as a tumor suppressor. Taken together,
our current data suggest that HSP70 belongs to
the group of proteins with “antagonistic duality”
[37] including c-myc and p21, which depending
on the circumstances may act as oncogenes or
tumor suppressors.
