ABSTRACT
Most mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastid protozoa require post-transcriptional RNA editing that inserts and deletes
uridylates, a process that is catalyzed by multiprotein editosomes. KREPA6 is the smallest of six editosome proteins that have
predicted oligonucleotide-binding (OB) folds. Inactivation of KREPA6 expression results in disruption and ultimate loss of ;20S
editosomes and inhibition of procyclic form cell growth. Gel shift studies show that recombinant KREPA6 binds RNA, but not
DNA, with a preference for oligo-(U) whether on the 39 end of gRNA or as a (UU)12 homopolymer. Thus, KREPA6 is essential for
the structural integrity and presence of ;20S editosomes and for cell viability. It functions in RNA binding perhaps primarily
through the gRNA 39 oligo(U) tail. The significance of these findings to key steps in editing is discussed.

Binding data were fit as described in Materials and Methods. Quantitation of the amount of HisKREPA6 bound to duplex pre-mRNATgRNA

to radiolabeled gA6[14] gRNA with an oligo(U) tail in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled competitor RNAs. (Lanes 8,9) The multiple
bands observed in the presence of excess unlabeled pre-mRNA are due to partially duplexed gRNATpre-mRNA and/or HisKREPA6 binding to
the duplex RNA. (B) Quantitation of the amount of gRNA binding in A, indicating the percent of gRNA bound in the presence of competitor
RNAs relative to their absence. (A, lane 2) The amount of HisKREPA6 bound to gRNA in the absence of competitor was set to 100%. The
competitor RNAs were gRNA with a U tail (black bars), gRNADU tail (striped bars), pre-mRNA (gray bars), and pBlueScript control RNA (white
bars). The apparent increase in HisKREPA6 gRNA binding in the presence of excess pre-mRNA >100% is due at least in part to formation of
partial gRNATpre-mRNA duplexes. (C) EMSA analysis of HisKREPA6 binding to radiolabeled gRNA with a U tail in the absence or presence of
excess unlabeled homopolymeric competitor RNAs. Molar excess was based on nucleotide gram weight estimate because of the heterogeneous
polymer sizes (10–70 nt) of the RNAs. (D) Quantitation of the amount of gRNA binding in C, indicating the percent of gRNA bound in the
presence of competitor RNAs relative to their absence. (C, lane 2) As in B, the amount of HisKREPA6 bound to gRNA in the absence of
