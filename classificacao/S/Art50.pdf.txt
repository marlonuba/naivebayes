                              Abstract | DNA methylation has two essential roles in plants and animals — defending the
                              genome against transposons and regulating gene expression. Recent experiments in
                              Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to address crucial questions about how DNA methylation is
                              established and maintained. One cardinal insight has been the discovery that DNA methylation
                              can be guided by small RNAs produced through RNA-interference pathways. Plants and
                              mammals use a similar suite of DNA methyltransferases to propagate DNA methylation, but
                              plants have also developed a glycosylase-based mechanism for removing DNA methylation, and
                              there are hints that similar processes function in other organisms.

                                     (DRM2), is orthologous to the mammalian DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 (DNMT3) (such as the mouse DNMT3B shown in
                                     the diagram) and both function to control de novo methylation. DRM2 differs from DNMT3 proteins in that it has a unique N terminus
                                     and that its catalytic domains are rearranged in the linear sequence. METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) is orthologous to the
                                     mammalian DNMT1 enzyme and both function to maintain CG methylation. Both MET1 and DNMT1 possess large N termini that
                                     contain bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domains. The DNMT2 class of methyltransferase is conserved in many eukaryote
