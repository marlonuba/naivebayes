             The mycobacterial IdeR protein is a metal-dependent regulator of the DtxR (diphtheria toxin repressor)
          family. In the presence of iron, it binds to a specific DNA sequence in the promoter regions of the genes that
          it regulates, thus controlling their transcription. In this study, we provide evidence that ideR is an essential
          gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. ideR cannot normally be disrupted in this mycobacterium in the absence of
          a second functional copy of the gene. However, a rare ideR mutant was obtained in which the lethal effects of
          ideR inactivation were alleviated by a second-site suppressor mutation and which exhibited restricted iron
          assimilation capacity. Studies of this strain and a derivative in which IdeR expression was restored allowed us
          to identify phenotypic effects resulting from ideR inactivation. Using DNA microarrays, the iron-dependent
          transcriptional profiles of the wild-type, ideR mutant, and ideR-complemented mutant strains were analyzed,
          and the genes regulated by iron and IdeR were identified. These genes encode a variety of proteins, including
          putative transporters, proteins involved in siderophore synthesis and iron storage, members of the PE/PPE
          family, a membrane protein involved in virulence, transcriptional regulators, and enzymes involved in lipid
          metabolism.

    A DNA microarray was used to measure mRNA levels in cultures of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (WT) during exponential growth under iron-deficient (2 ␮M FeCl3)
(LI) or -sufficient (50 ␮M FeCl3) (HI) conditions and in exponential cultures of strains ST22 and ST52 grown in iron-sufficient medium. Differences in gene-specific
RNA levels of twofold or more are listed. Genes contiguous to included genes and with a ratio of ⬎1.6 after the standard deviation was subtracted are also listed. Genes
that required IdeR for repression were repressed under high-iron conditions in the wild-type strain (WT LI/HI ⬎ 2.0), derepressed in the ideR mutant ST22 under
high-iron conditions (ST22 HI/WT HI ⬎ 2.0), and repressed in the mutant complemented strain ST52 under high-iron conditions to the same levels observed in the
wild type under high iron conditions (ST52 HI/WT HI ⫽ 1.0). The genes are annotated as described by the Pasteur Institute on TUBERCULIST (http://
genolist.pasteur.fr/Tuberculist), except for those indicated by an asterisk. Those genes are annotated based on individual BLAST searches. Genes that are separated
by ⬍50 bp and probably coregulated are grouped.

     A DNA microarray was used to measure mRNA levels in cultures of M. tuberculosis H37Rv during exponential growth under iron-deficient (2 ␮M FeCl3) (LI) or
-sufficient (50 ␮M FeCl3) (HI) conditions and in exponential cultures of strains ST22 and ST52 grown in iron-sufficient medium. Differences in gene-specific mRNA
levels of twofold and higher are listed. Iron- and IdeR-induced genes were identified as genes induced under high-iron conditions in the wild-type strain (WT HI/LI
⬎ 2), not induced under high-iron conditions in the ideR mutant ST22 (WT HI/ST22 HI ⬎ 2), and induced under high-iron conditions in the complemented strain ST52
to levels comparable to those in the wild type under high-iron conditions (WT HI/ST52 HI ⫽ 1.0). The Genes are annotated as described by the Pasteur Institute on
TUBERCULIST (http://genolist.pasteur.fr/Tuberculist).

associated mycobactin produced by the wild-type, ST22 (ideR),                      required to achieve total repression of mycobactin varied from
and ST52 (ideR-complemented) strains when grown under                              experiment to experiment, probably due to variations in the
low- and high-iron conditions. The wild-type and comple-
mented strains repressed mycobactin production under high-
iron conditions, while the ideR mutant strain failed to repress
mycobactin synthesis and accumulated this siderophore in an
iron-independent manner (Fig. 6). Accumulated ferric myco-
bactin is likely to account for the orange pigment showed by
this strain when grown in iron-rich medium. From these re-
sults, we conclude that IdeR is the main regulator of mycobac-
tin production in M. tuberculosis.
   The repression of mycobactin genes and mycobactin produc-
tion by high levels of iron in the complemented strain is con-
tradictory to the postulated action of the suppressor mutation
in iron assimilation. If this mutation affects iron assimilation,
the available iron in the complemented strain should be re-
duced and expression of iron-regulated genes should be af-
fected. It is possible that 50 ␮M FeCl3, used in these experi-
ments as high-iron conditions, was sufficient to allow efficient                      FIG. 6. Regulation of mycobactin production. Levels of cell-asso-

we consistently observed that more FeCl3 was required to
repress mycobactin production in the complemented strain
than in the wild-type strain. Maximum repression of mycobac-
tin in the wild-type strain required 20 to 25 ␮M FeCl3, whereas
the same effect in the complemented strain required 50 to 100
␮M FeCl3. A representative experiment is presented in Fig. 7.
