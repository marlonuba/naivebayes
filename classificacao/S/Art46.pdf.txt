Abstract

   The inability of the cattle pathogen Trypanosoma brucei brucei to infect humans is due to an innate factor in human serum
termed Trypanosome Lytic Factor (TLF). Human haptoglobin-related protein is the proposed toxin in TLF and can exist either
as a component of a minor subclass of high-density lipoprotein (TLF-1) or as a lipid free, high molecular weight protein complex
(TLF-2). The trypanolytic activity of both TLF-1 and TLF-2 has been studied in vitro but their relative contributions to
protection against T. b. brucei infection in vivo has not been established. In the present studies we show that treatment of T. b.
brucei infected mice with TLF-1 resulted in a dose dependent decrease in parasite numbers but did not affect parasite numbers
in mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the causative agent of the human sleeping sickness. Similarly, pretreatment
of mice with TLF-1 resulted in protection against a challenge by T. b. brucei but had no effect on T. b. rhodesiense challenge.
Induction of the acute phase protein haptoglobin, a natural antagonist of TLF-1, diminished but did not abolish the protection
against trypanosome challenge. In addition, haptoglobin knockout mice showed higher levels of TLF-1 mediated protection
against a T. b. brucei challenge. These results suggest that while TLF-1 is active in vivo, even in the presence of elevated levels
of haptoglobin, its activity is modulated in a dose dependent fashion by haptoglobin in the circulation. © 2001 Elsevier Science

challenge (Fig. 1B).
   A dose dependent effect was also seen when T. b.
brucei infected mice were treated with TLF-1 (Fig.
1C,D). Mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection
and parasite numbers were monitored until the para-
siteamia reached 1× 107 trypanosomes ml − 1 in the
blood. Mice were then treated with 3– 600 U of TLF-1
by intraperitoneal injection. The number of parasites in
the circulation decreased dramatically after 2 h and the
morphological appearance of the parasites was consis-
tent with the pathway of TLF-1 lysis proposed based
on in vitro studies [20]. Although the elapsed time for
lysis is longer in vivo, the changing morphology of the
trypanosomes is identical. Treatment of C57BL/6J mice
with high concentrations of TLF-1 (600 U) cured T. b.
brucei infections (Fig. 1D). Based on these results we
conclude that TLF-1 is active in normal mice both in
