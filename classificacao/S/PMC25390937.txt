     Abstract
     Eupatorin is a naturally occurring flavone that inhibits cell proliferation in human tumor cells. Here we demonstrate that
     eupatorin arrests cells at the G2-M phase of the cell cycle and induces apoptotic cell death involving activation of multiple
     caspases, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in human leukemia cells. This
     flavonoid induced the phosphorylation of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and cell death was attenuated
     by inhibition of c-jun N-terminal kinases/stress activated protein kinases. Eupatorin-induced cell death is mediated by both
     the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways and through a mechanism dependent on reactive oxygen species
     generation.

Western Blot Analysis
  Immunoblot analysis of Bcl-2 family members, caspases,

described [13]. Purity of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was
determined by probing with antibodies to cytochrome c oxidase
and b-actin, respectively.

   Caspase activity was evaluated by measuring proteolytic
cleavage of the chromogenic substrates LEHD-pNA (for caspase-
9 activity), IETD-pNA (for caspase-8 activity), VEID-pNA (for
caspase-6 activity) and DEVD-pNA (for caspase-3 like protease
activity) as described previously [12].
