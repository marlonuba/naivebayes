T. cruzi trypomastigotes. (1) Secreted/released trypomastigote molecule(s) stimulate TGF-β receptors in epithelial cells and activate transcription
of TGF-β-responsive genes such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). (2) Cytosolic T. cruzi oligopeptidase B cleaves an inactive precursor
to generate an active Ca2+-agonist that is released from the parasite and binds a pertussis-toxin sensitive G-protein-coupled receptor. This
stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) activity to generate inositol, 3,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) which binds its receptor and promotes release of Ca2+
from intracellular stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). (3) Cruzipain (Cz) secreted from the flagellar pocket (FP) of T. cruzi cleaves
host high molecular weight kininogen (H-K) to generate short-lived kinins (k) which bind to the bradykinin receptor (B2K) to stimulate IP3-mediated
Ca2+ release. (4) Bi-directional Ca2+-signalling mediated by metacyclic surface glycoprotein, gp82 binding to unknown host cell receptor. (5) Trans-
sialidase (TS)-mediated stimulation of host cell PI-3-kinase (p85/p110) signalling, activation of downstream serine/threonine kinase Akt, phos-
phorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) and activation of bcl-2 transcription. (6) Stimulation of host cell adenyl cyclase (AC) by a T. cruzi
