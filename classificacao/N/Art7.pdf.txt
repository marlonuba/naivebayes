pensability. Essential proteins generally have more interactions than the nonessential ones. We
show here that the lethality associated with removal of a protein from the yeast proteome corre-
lates with different centrality measures of the nodes in the PIN, such as the closeness of a protein
to many other proteins, or the number of pairs of proteins which need a specific protein as an
intermediary in their communications, or the participation of a protein in different protein
clusters in the PIN. These measures are significantly better than random selection in identifying
essential proteins in a PIN. Centrality measures based on graph spectral properties of the net-
work, in particular the subgraph centrality, show the best performance in identifying essential
proteins in the yeast PIN. Subgraph centrality gives important structural information about the
role of individual proteins, and permits the selection of possible targets for rational drug dis-
covery through the identification of essential proteins in the PIN.
