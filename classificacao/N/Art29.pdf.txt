Figure 1. The use of the genome-wide collection of yeast deletion mutants in drug discovery. In a typical yeast collection, each yeast open reading frame (ORF) has been
replaced with a cassette containing unique tag sequences that enable rapid parallel analysis of strains in a pool by using hybridization to a high-density nucleotide array
(e.g. [55]). More specifically, the ORFs are replaced by a cassette containing a selectable marker gene such as KanMX, which confers geneticin (G418) resistance, and
two 20-nucleotide ‘barcodes’ uniquely assigned to the marker gene. The barcode sequences, called UPTAGs and DOWNTAGs, are flanked with universal priming sets (U) for
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and the resulting products can be used as hybridization probes to identify each mutant. The resultant hybridization pattern can
be used to determine the presence, absence or under- or over-representation of a particular mutant in a population after treatment with chemical compounds or other types
of environmental changes. A variation on the collection of (tagged) yeast deletion mutants is a library consisting of diploid yeast strains each being heterozygous for a
specific gene. Qualitatively, the deletion of one of two functionally equivalent duplicate gene copies will have no obvious phenotypic effect. However, if one quantitatively
measures the effect of the reduced level of a certain gene product, it can make a difference. This phenomenon is called haplo-insufficiency [31] because the reduced
concentration of a certain gene product might be insufficient to ensure growth and division at the normal rate. The heterozygous diploid library, therefore, can be screened for
phenotypic effects (e.g. retarded growth as a result of the exposure to certain chemical compounds). Consistently, this type of screening has been called drug-induced haplo-
insufficiency screening because it presumes that lowering the level of expression of a specific gene will render the corresponding strain sensitive to a target drug or toxin [31].
Subsequently, the target gene can be identified by PCR-mediated amplification and hybridization to DNA microarrays.

Figure 2. Global strategy to relate chemical compounds to their putative cellular targets. If deletion of gene 1 or deletion of gene n shows a viable phenotype, whereas the
double deletion of gene 1 and gene n is lethal, genes 1 and n are said to be synthetically lethal (a). Synthetic lethality suggests a functional relationship of the corresponding
genes. In the past, this method has been employed frequently in classical yeast genetics. Recently, the technique has been used in a global version, and a genome-wide array
of synthetic lethal interactions has been set up [7] (b). In the example, gene a is synthetically lethal with genes 2, 3 and z (because the pertinent double deletion strains do not
show growth) but not with genes 1, 4, 5 or 6 (because the pertinent double deletion strains are viable). Deletion of a gene can be mimicked by functional inhibition of its gene
product. Based on this, synthetic lethality can also arise from deletion of one gene and inhibition of the protein (Ap) encoded by another gene (c). This principle has also been
applied in a genome-wide manner, by the development of synthetic chemical-genetic arrays [36] (d). In the example, the global pattern of synthetic lethality of the drug of
interest is similar to that obtained with gene a. The results therefore strongly suggest that the product of gene a is the target of this drug.

three-component interaction does not need to be a protein but can be RNA, a hormone or even a drug. Note that instead of a gain-of-function system, two-hybrid analysis can
also be used to study loss-of-function based on the absence of transcription of the URA3 gene, enabling yeast cells to grow in the presence of 5-fluoro-orotic acid. Instead of a
transcriptional read-out, a ‘signaling read-out’ has been employed in the so-called SOS recruitment system (hSOS is a human Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factor) (b) and
its derived Ras recruitment systems (c) [58]. These screening systems are based on the observation that an active GTP-bound Ras protein is required at the plasma membrane
to sustain growth of yeast cells in the absence of the endogenous guanyl nucleotide exchange factor CDC25. Protein sequences indicated by ‘cDNA’ (b) or ‘bait’ (c) are
localized to the plasma membrane via a myristoylated tag. A fourth method makes use of the split-ubiquitin approach (d) where the interaction of two proteins enables
reconstitution of ubiquitin, which in turn gives rise to proteolytic cleavage and subsequent release of a transcription factor (TF) that triggers induction of a gene encoding a
detectable reporter [59]. NubG and Cub represent, respectively, N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of ubiquitin. It should be noted that the split-ubiquitin systems in
addition to the SOS and Ras recruitment systems have proven to be successful in the identification of interactions between proteins without nuclear localization signals, such
as membrane proteins. The two-hybrid systems illustrated differ with respect to the cellular location where the protein–protein interaction occurs. The original two-hybrid
method in (a) is based on interaction in the nucleus, whereas the interactions in (b) and (c) occur at the plasma membrane, and the interaction in (d) is cytosolic, although also
in the latter case a transcriptional read-out is used.
