                                                    28 kDa. GhAPX1 showed the highest substrate specificity for ascorbate.

Identification of a cotton APX by proteomic analysis
during cotton fibre development
Proteomic analysis was performed on 10 dpa wild-type cotton
ovules associated with fibres. For control purpose, 10 dpa fl
mutant cotton ovules were also analysed. Proteins extracted
from the cotton ovules were analysed by 2-D gel electrophoresis.
A total of 1240 ± 20 protein spots were detected on both gels
in three independent experiments (see the Supplementary
Material, Fig. S1). The numbered spots were excised from
gels, in-gel digested with trypsin and subjected to MALDI-
TOF MS (Fig. S1). Among them, 61 proteins showing highly
up-regulated (see the Supplementary Material, Table S1),
downregulated (Table S2) were identified, compared with
intensity of the relatively unchanged or housekeeping cotton
proteins (Table S3). Spots 1–4, highly accumulated in 10 dpa
wild-type ovules associated with fibres (Fig. 1), were all identified
as ascorbate peroxidase encoded by the same APX gene (Table
S1) through NCBInr database searches using the MASCOT
search engine (http://www.matrixscience.com), and the peptides
obtained from these four spots were matched perfectly with
the deduced amino acid sequence of GhAPX1 (Table S4).
Four unique peptides from each of intensive spots 1–4 (Fig. 1)
had monocharged ions mass peaks at m/z (mass/charge) m/z
1331.1, m/z 2076.9, m/z 1612 and m/z 2320.1, indicating
that the spots were GhAPX1 analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS
(Table S4) and MALDI-TOF MS/MS (Fig. S2).
