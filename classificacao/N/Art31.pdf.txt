       During a decade of proof-of-principle analysis in model organisms, protein networks have been used to further the
       study of molecular evolution, to gain insight into the robustness of cells to perturbation, and for assignment of new
       protein functions. Following these analyses, and with the recent rise of protein interaction measurements in
       mammals, protein networks are increasingly serving as tools to unravel the molecular basis of disease. We review
       promising applications of protein networks to disease in four major areas: identifying new disease genes; the study
       of their network properties; identifying disease-related subnetworks; and network-based disease classification.
       Applications in infectious disease, personalized medicine, and pharmacology are also forthcoming as the available
       protein network information improves in quality and coverage.
