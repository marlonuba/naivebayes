Identification of protein–protein interactions often provides insight into protein function, and many cellular processes are
performed by stable protein complexes. We used tandem affinity purification to process 4,562 different tagged proteins
of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each preparation was analysed by both matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to increase coverage
and accuracy. Machine learning was used to integrate the mass spectrometry scores and assign probabilities to the
protein–protein interactions. Among 4,087 different proteins identified with high confidence by mass spectrometry from
2,357 successful purifications, our core data set (median precision of 0.69) comprises 7,123 protein–protein interactions
involving 2,708 proteins. A Markov clustering algorithm organized these interactions into 547 protein complexes
averaging 4.9 subunits per complex, about half of them absent from the MIPS database, as well as 429 additional
interactions between pairs of complexes. The data (all of which are available online) will help future studies on individual
proteins as well as functional genomics and systems biology.
