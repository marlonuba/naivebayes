be found to be synthetically lethal (i.e. cell death
occurs when a pair of non-essential genes is deleted
simultaneously). Because essentiality can be deter-
mined without knowing the function of a gene
(e.g. random transposon mutagenesis [1,2] or gene-
deletion [3]), it is a powerful descriptor and starting
point for further analysis when no other information is
available for a particular gene.
   Although the definition of essentiality is not novel,

Figure 2. The likelihood of essentiality for different classes of genes. (a) Protein hubs in the interaction network tend to be essential. Based on the degree distribution
(Figure 1 in the supplementary online), 1061 proteins were considered as protein hubs, within which the percentage of essential proteins was examined. ‘Whole genome’
refers to the likelihood that all proteins in the whole genome that have at least one interaction partner to be essential. There are, in total, 4743 proteins with at least one
interaction partner in the dataset, among which 977 (,20%) are known to be essential. (b) Transcription factors (TFs) with many (. 100) targets are more likely (P , 1027) to
be essential than the other proteins. (c) Genes with many regulating TFs ($ 10) are less likely (P , 10212) to be essential than those with only a few TFs (2 –9), whereas these
genes are less likely (P , 10202) to be essential than those with only one TF. (d) Genes with more functions are more likely to be essential. Proteins whose function is
annotated as ‘unclassified’ in MIPS are considered to have zero function in this analysis. The P-value measures the difference between genes with only one function and
those with more than four functions. The P-values in all panels are calculated by the cumulative binomial distribution.

inal datasets, except the growth rate data, which were baseline corrected. Before calculating the marginal essentiality, we verified that the four datasets were mutually inde-
pendent. Although other methods could also be used to define marginal essentiality, we determined that different definitions have little effect (supplementary material
