        The mechanistic bases for gene essentiality and for cell mutational resistance have long been disputed. The
        recent availability of large protein interaction databases has fuelled the analysis of protein interaction
        networks and several authors have proposed that gene dispensability could be strongly related to some
        topological parameters of these networks. However, many results were based on protein interaction data
        whose biases were not taken into account. In this article, we show that the essentiality of a gene in yeast is
        poorly related to the number of interactants (or degree) of the corresponding protein and that the
        physiological consequences of gene deletions are unrelated to several other properties of proteins in the
        interaction networks, such as the average degrees of their nearest neighbours, their clustering coefficients
        or their relative distances. We also found that yeast protein interaction networks lack degree correlation, i.e.
        a propensity for their vertices to associate according to their degrees. Gene essentiality and more generally
        cell resistance against mutations thus seem largely unrelated to many parameters of protein network
        topology.
