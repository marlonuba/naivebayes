   Fig. 5 shows an example of the centrifugation           patterns of
catalase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase,       and lysozyme obtained
by this method.      The dotted lines represent the corresponding
enzymes which have been diluted to the same concentration           in a
crude extract of S. typhimurium.         The distance in centimeters
from the meniscus to the enzyme peak was estimated to two deci-

of the enzyme peaks from the meniscus, as determined from Fig.

plotted as a function of the time of centrifugation.       The time of
centrifugation   was corrected to the equivalent time at 38,000

and for the time of rotor acceleration          and deceleration.)     A
