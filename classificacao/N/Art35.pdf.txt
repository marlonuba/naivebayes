                           Functional compensation by duplicated genes in mouse

                                              It has been thought that functional loss of a gene due to null mutation can often be compensated
                                              by its paralog(s). Indeed, the genome-wide single-gene knockout or knockdown data in yeast
                                              and worm showed that the proportion of essential genes (PE) in singletons is substantially
                                              greater than that in duplicates1, 2; we consider a gene to be ‘essential’ if its deletion leads to
                                              lethality or sterility. However, the mouse knockout data3 collected from individual
                                              experimental studies showed similar PE values for singletons and for duplicates4, 5. This
                                              puzzling observation has attracted much attention6, 7. Here we propose an explanation.

                           Essentialities of singletons and duplicates in the mouse genome
                                              Recently Makino et al.6 found that developmental genes tend to be more essential than other
                                              genes and are highly enriched in the mouse knockout dataset. Here, we show that this
                                              enrichment does not cause a significant bias in the relative PE values for singletons and
                                              duplicates at the genome level, because the enrichment exists for both singletons and
                                              duplicates. From the dataset of Makino et al., we calculate the PE values for singletons and for
                                              duplicates in the mouse genome after adjusting the bias of developmental genes (Supplemental
                                              materials online). Interestingly, although both genome-wide PE values become substantially
                                              lower than those in the knockout dataset (singletons: from 42.2% to 35.6%; and duplicates:
                                              from 41.4% to 32.8%, Table S1), they are still similar (p = 0.09, χ2 = 2.9, Table S2). Next, we
                                              consider another bias in the knockout dataset6, namely the enrichment of duplicate genes from
                                              whole-genome duplications. After adjusting for the functional bias, this factor has a less than
                                              1% effect on the genome-wide PE estimate (Supplemental Materials).

                           singletons
                                              Why is the PE for mouse duplicates similar to that for singletons even at the genome level?
                                              One possible reason is unequal functional partition between singletons and duplicates (i.e. a
                                              higher proportion of developmental genes and a lower proportion of un-annotated genes in
                                              duplicates than in singletons). However, the observation6 that among mouse developmental
                                              genes, the PE for duplicates is even higher than that for singletons further suggests that there
                                              were other confounding factors.

                                          From the perspective of systems biology, the centrality of a gene in a biological network can
                                          affect gene essentiality8. Previously, we found that mouse duplicates tend to have more
                                          interacting partners in the protein interaction network and that genes encoding hub proteins

                                          are more likely to be essential4. Thus, is the higher essentiality of developmental duplicates
                                          due in part to their higher centrality in the network? We use the high-quality protein interaction
                                          data set9 from a systematic examination of all binary interactions among ~7,200 human
                                          proteins; this dataset is less biased than those collected from individual studies. For mouse
                                          developmental genes with phenotypic data, we use their human orthologs and the human
                                          protein interaction data to calculate the connectivity and betweenness of mouse proteins, which
                                          are two frequently-used indexes for quantifying the centrality of a node in a network. Indeed,
                                          we find that developmental duplicates have higher network centrality than developmental
                                          singletons; the same trend also holds for all the duplicates and the singletons in the dataset
                                          (Table 1). We obtain similar results using other protein interaction datasets (data not shown).

                              Unbiased estimation of functional compensation by duplicates
                                          Thus, both functionality and network centrality can influence PE estimation. To control these
                                          two factors, we compare the PE values for the sets of singletons and duplicates that have the
                                          same functionalities and the same connectivities. In total, there are 1,847 mouse genes with
                                          both interaction and knockout phenotypic data, and we classify them into three centrality
                                          groups: low-, median- and high-connectivity (centrality refers to connectivity here and in the
NIH-PA Author Manuscript




                                          remaining text). We calculate PE for each group of duplicates with the same functional
                                          classification and centrality classification; to obtain the averaged PE of mouse duplicates in
                                          the dataset, we give their weights according to the proportions of their corresponding groups
                                          in singletons (Supplemental Materials).

                                          Although in the original dataset the PE values for singletons and duplicates are similar (45.7%
                                          vs. 42.4%, p = 0.22, χ2 = 1.5), after controlling for both functionality and centrality biases, the
                                          adjusted PE for duplicates is 39.0% (Fig. 1), ~7% lower than that for singletons (p = 0.01, χ2
                                          = 6.4, Table S6). This number implies that ~15% of the single-gene deletions that otherwise
                                          would be lethal (or infertile) are viable (or fertile) due to duplicate functional compensation.
                                          Thus, the contribution of functional compensation by duplicates seems significant. Su and
                                          Gu7 recently showed that young duplicates are under-represented in the knockout dataset.
                                          Because the backup role of young duplicates is likely to be stronger than old duplicates, the
                                          functional compensation by duplicates for the genome is likely to be higher than we estimated
                                          above.

                              Concluding remarks
NIH-PA Author Manuscript




                                          We have provided a systems-level explanation for the observation that developmental genes
                                          are more essential6. Our results highlight the importance of controlling confounding factors in
                                          studying the role of duplicates in genetic robustness. Conventionally, the contribution to
                                          functional compensation by duplicates is inferred by directly comparing the PE value for
                                          duplicates with that for singletons, and similar PE values are usually taken as evidence that
                                          there is no contribution due to duplicate genes. However, the functional partitioning and
                                          network centrality for duplicates might be different from those for singletons. It should be
                                          emphasized that even when the genome-wide phenotypic data of single-gene deletion is
                                          available, correcting for such intrinsic differences is still necessary.

                                          Of course, our analyses only represent an initial effort to adjust confounding factors. Because
                                          current protein interaction datasets are incomplete, an estimation of functional compensation
                                          by duplicates in the whole mouse genome is still not feasible. Moreover, other potential
                                          confounding factors remain to be explored. Nevertheless, our study provides a general
