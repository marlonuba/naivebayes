       Many important cellular functions are implemented by protein complexes that act as sophisticated molecular
       machines of varying size and temporal stability. Here we demonstrate quantitatively that protein complexes in the
       yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are comprised of a core in which subunits are highly coexpressed, display the same
       deletion phenotype (essential or nonessential), and share identical functional classification and cellular localization.
       This core is surrounded by a functionally mixed group of proteins, which likely represent short-lived or spurious
       attachments. The results allow us to define the deletion phenotype and cellular task of most known complexes, and
       to identify with high confidence the biochemical role of hundreds of proteins with yet unassigned functionality.

Figure 1 Characterizing three essential and nonessential complexes. (A, column I) mRNA coexpression patterns for three large complexes identified
in Gavin et al. (2002). For each protein subunit (identified at the bottom of each panel), we show the average correlation coefficient for their
corresponding relative mRNA expression level with all other subunits based on the microarray data obtained on gene deletion mutants (CD, top plot;
Winzeler et al. 1999; Hughes et al. 2000), and cell cycle measurements (CC, bottom plot; Cho et al. 1998; Spellman et al. 1998). We denote by red the
known essential proteins and by black the nonessential proteins. (Column II) Cross-correlation plot obtained by plotting for each protein i within the
three selected complexes the cell cycle correlation coefficient CiC on the horizontal axis, and the gene deletion correlation coefficient CiD on the vertical
axis. Each symbol corresponds to a single gene product (protein), the color reflecting its known deletion phenotype (red: essential; black: nonessential).
The shaded area separates the highly coexpressed core proteins, the boundaries of the area being given by CiC = CC ⳮ ␴C and CiD = CD ⳮ ␴D. (Column
III) The same coexpression plot as in column II, but the symbols are color-coded based on the functional classification of the corresponding proteins.
The green symbols denote gene products that belong to the majority regarding their known functional role (Complexes 365 and 360: green proteins
simultaneously belong to protein fate and subcellular localization; Complex 363: transcription) unfilled symbols denote proteins with unknown
functional role; and the blue symbols denote those subunits that do not share the functional classification with the majority. (Column IV) Coexpression
plot with proteins colored based on their known cellular localization. Green symbols denote those with the same subcellular localization, which is nucleus
for all three complexes. Blue symbols denote proteins whose localization differs from the majority, and unfilled symbols represent those with unknown
cellular localization. In columns II–IV, we used a two-dimensional representation to demonstrate that the essentiality-, functional-classification-, and
cellular-localization-based separation is simultaneously present by using two widely different transcriptional data sets. A control plot with only the Cho
et al. (1998) cell cycle data is shown in the Supplemental material. (B) The same as A, but for three complexes with predominantly nonessential subunits.
In column II, we used red squares to denote those essential proteins that are part of the core of other essential complexes. In column III, the green
symbols represent proteins participating in synthesis. In column IV, the green symbols denote proteins localized in the mitochondria for all three
complexes.

Figure 2 Characterization of the protein complex ensemble and schematic illustration of the internal organization of protein complexes. (A) The
number of complexes in the Gavin et al. (2002) data set that are found to be essential (red), nonessential (black), and of unknown (white) deletion
phenotype. Next to each column we show the number of corresponding complexes if the proteins were randomly distributed in the various complexes,
indicating the highly nonrandom character of the complex composition and essentiality. For this, each protein subunit of the known Gavin et al. (2002)
complexes is replaced with proteins randomly selected from the yeast proteome. (B) The size dependence of essentiality in protein complexes. The plot
shows the fraction of essential subunits within the complex (vertical axis) as a function of the number of protein subunits in the complexes (horizontal
axis). (C) The predicted functional classification of the complexes identified by Gavin et al. (2002), showing separately the number of essential and
nonessential complexes found in each functional class. (D) The predicted cellular localization of the identified essential and nonessential complexes. A
full list of predictions for each complex is shown in the Supplemental material. (E) We find that ∼ 43% of the protein complexes possess a core comprised
of highly coexpressed proteins, that are all essential and belong to the same functional class, indicating that they represent the functional building blocks
of the complex. Such core is shown schematically as tightly locked P1–P5 proteins. Mass spectroscopic methods inevitably identify other proteins as well
with those complexes. Yet, we find that these halo proteins (P6–P9) show a small coexpression pattern with the core, and are both phenotypically and
functionally mixed, indicating that they likely represent proteins that display only temporal or spurious attachment to the complex. (F) Approximately
46% of the complexes have a core composed of predominantly nonessential proteins (P1–P5), surrounded again by a halo of proteins with mixed
essentiality and functional classification (P6–P8). These complexes likely are not essential for cell growth; therefore, all core proteins are uniformly
nonessential. The few essential proteins found predominantly in the halo of such nonessential complexes often simultaneously take part in the core of
other essential complexes, explaining the origin of their essentiality. For example, the P1 protein, which is part of the core of the essential complex shown
in E, could also attach to the surface of the nonessential complex shown in F. Therefore, the essentiality of P1* is derived not from its role in complex
F, but from its role in the essential complex E.
