   Microbiological methods for the determination of amino acids, becauseof
their specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, and ability to yield many replicate




                                                                                                        Downloaded from http://www.jbc.org/ at CAPES/MEC - UFSM on December 15, 2015
results within a short time, promise to become of increasing importance in
investigations of the chemistry and biochemistry of proteins and amino
acids. Although such methods are of relatively recent origin, a considerable
and rapidly increasing number are already available for the assay of many
of the amino acids in purified proteins and natural products. Since a pre-
vious review of the literature (l), a method for lysine (2) and additional
methods for tryptophane (3) and glutamic acid (4,5) have been published.
Also a fungus method is available for the assay of leucine (6).
   With the exception of leucine (6-8), isoleucine (7), valine (7, 8), and
tryptophane (3,9), microbiological methods have either not been developed
or existing methods have not been shown to be applicable to the determina-
tion of the essential amino acids in meats, grains, milk, and other natural
materials. It is in the analysis of such substances rather than purified
proteins that microbiological methods will find their most extensive appli-
cation. Also the analysis of a protein for those amino acids which can be
measured by established microbiological methods involves use of a variety
of microorganisms, media, and details of procedure. This is confusing and
troublesome even to those who have considerable experience with micro-
biological assay methods. Experience with the latter suggested that a
large degree of standardization and, therefore, simplification of amino acid
methods was possible and highly desirable. The present paper describes a
basic method for the assay of the ten essential amino acids, namely histidine,
arginine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, threonine, trypto-
phane, and phenylalanine, which is applicable to foodstuffs and other nat-
ural products    as well as to purified proteins and synthetic amino acid mix-
tures.   A complete analysis can be made with 1.5 gm. or less of sample.
Nine of the amino acids are determined with Streptococcus faecalis and
phenylalanine with Lactobacillus delbriickii LD5.l Although two organisms

are used, only one standard medium and one procedure are employed.      The
response of the two organisms to the amino acids is measured by titrating,
with standard alkali, the lactic acid produced during growth.

  The described procedure applies to both Streptococcus faecalis and Lacto-
bacillus delbriickii except for two indicated minor details and is similar in
most respects to that already outlined (1).

except that Streptococcus faecalis is suspended in 100 cc. of water after being
centrifuged and washed.       Although one experiment indicated that Lacto-
btiUus delbriickii also could be diluted to the same degree, most of the
assay media were inoculated with cells suspended in 20 cc. of water.

medium.       Stock solutions of the amino acids, salts, and vitamins are pre-
pared as indicated previously (1) with the following changes and additions.
Owing to difficulty in obtaining I(-)-tryptophane,                 the dl form is used.
Because of its lesser solubility, stock solutions are prepared with 0.2 N HCI

y of thiamine hydrochloride          and 10 y of p-aminobenzoic          acid are also re-
quired.    A solution of pyridoxamine           dihydrochloride     is prepared in a con-
centration of 100 y of pyridoxamine              per cc., in place of the more dilute
solution previously        described, to avoid excessive dilution of the basal
medium.       It is stable for at least a month when preserved with toluene and
stored in the refrigerator.
   Preparation of Samples for Assay-Fresh,               moist substances such as vege-
tables or meats are sliced and dried at 100” sufficiently to permit grinding
into a homogeneous mass. It is not necessary to free the samples of fatty
materials or any other constituent prior to hydrolysis                or assay.   1 gm. of
dried impure protein is autoclaved with 10 cc. of 10 per cent HC12 in sealed
ampuls of 20 cc. capacity for 10 hours at 15 pounds pressure and prepared
for assay as out,lined earlier (1). This quantity should be sufficient for
determining all of the essential amino acids except tryptophane                  which re-
quires a separate alkaline hydrolysis.              With purified proteins and other
matserials available only in small quantities, the amount hydrolyzed may be
reduced considerably, the degree depending upon the amino acid content of
the sample.       This can be calculated, approximately,          from the sensitivity of
each assay as indicated by the standard curves (Fig. 1). Use of smaller
samples is possible also if only some of the essential amino acids are to be
determined.       A further reduction should be possible by decreasing, pro-
portionately,    the scale of the assay from 10 cc. total volume per assay tube
to 2.5 cc. or less (10, 11).
   For the determination         of tryptophane,      0.5 gm. of sample is hydrolyzed
with 10 cc. of 5 N NaOH in 50 cc. Pyrex Erlenmeyer flasks plugged with
non-absorbent       cotton.    Hydrolysis     in sealed ampuls should also be satis-
factory and perhaps preferable, since appreciable amounts of water some-
times enter the flasks during autoclaving.              In the case of purified proteins,
25 mg. are hydrolyzed with 2 cc. of alkali in sealed ampuls.                 The quantity
of sample may be reduced as indicated above for acid hydrolysis.                     Diges-
tion is carried out at 15 pounds steam pressure for 10 hours as for acid hy-
  2 Concentrated HCl     (about 38 per cent) is diluted     with water to 10 per cent, by
volume, of HCl .

dl racemate of each amino acid, under our conditions, was exactly one-
half as active as the I isomer, indicating that the d or unnatural isomer
is inactive (12). Data for threonine, which is typical of all the amino acids,
are given in Table II. Identical standard curves were obtained with the 1
and dl forms when twice as much of the latter as compared to the 1 isomer
was used. Therefore, either form can be used as the standard.          It is im-
portant, obviously, that amino acids of known purity be employed.        It may
be necessary to purify commerical dl-leucine (13) and dl-isoleucine.

conveniently.       These secondary dilutions, also, may be preserved.           The
dilutions must be made so that the maximum volume of standard added to
the assay tubes does not exceed 5 cc.
    Assay Procedure-This        is identical with that already outlined (1) except
for the following minor changes applicable only to assays with Streptococcus
faecalis; there are no changes for the assay of phenylalanine with Lacto-
bacillus delbriickii.    Streptococcus famalis assays are titrated with approxi-
mately 0.05 N NaOH after 40 hours incubation at which time maximum
acid production has occurred.            Some experiments have indicated that it
may be possible to reduce the incubation period to 16 hours for most routine
work and that as an alternative to titration the turbidity           of the cultures
may be measured with a photoelectric cell. However, the latter can be

with 10 cc. of HCl and the hydrolysate neutralized, filtered, and adjusted to
100 cc. ; a further 1: 12.5 dilution was made prior to assay (Table III).
   Alkaline hydrolysis used to liberate tryptophane from proteins results in
complete racemization of this amino acid. Since the d form is inactive for
Stre@ococcus juecalis, assay values must be multiplied by a factor of 2 to
arrive at the final correct tryptophane content of the protein.

                                                       DISCUSSION

   Streptococcus jaecalis was selected for use in the assays because, in con-
trast to the commonly employed Lactobacillus      casei and Lactobacillus arab-
inosus, its amino acid requirements are not influenced by pyridoxamine or
pyridoxal; those members of the vitamin Bc group can substitute for lysine
and threonine in the nutrition of the lactobacilli (14). The latter are un-
suitable, therefore, for the assay of lysine and threonine, since pyridoxa-
mine and pyridoxal or closely related compounds are commonly present in
natural products (15) or are formed readily in the assay medium during
sterilization (14, 16).
   Although initial, short time experiments appeared to indicate that
Streptococcus jaecalis required all ten essential amino acids for full growth,
subsequent experience disclosedthat the almost imperceptible development
evident in 16 to 20 hours, in the absenceof phenylalanine, rapidly increased
to maximum growth and acid production in 40 hours. Inability to obtain
cultures from thirty-five single colonies which had an absolute requirement
for phenylalanine suggests that Streptococcus jaecalis is able to synthesize
phenylalanine, although too slowly to permit a normal rate of growth.
This situation is analogous to that of the rat with respect to arginine (17).

Lactobacillus arabinosus also developed without phenylalanine.             This was
not unexpected, since its need for phenylalanine is dependent, critically, on
the composition of the growth medium (18). However, Lactobacillus del-
briickii LD5, Lcwtobacillus casei, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides P-60 failed
to grow unless phenylalanine was in the medium and they responded in ap-
proximately     linear fashion to increments of the amino acid. The former
was chosen for development of the phenylalanine assay, because previous
experience with it in amino acid assays was available (1).
    The basal medium (Table I.) resembles, closely, those proposed for other




                                                                                       Downloaded from http://www.jbc.org/ at CAPES/MEC - UFSM on December 15, 2015
microbial amino acid assay methods.          Although the number of ingredients is
formidable, most of them are essential for growth.           The amino acids and
growth factors are in excess both in number and quantity.              Thus proline,
hydroxyproline,      norleucine, and glycine are not essential for the growth of
either assay organism and the same applies to thiamine andp-aminobenzoic
acid and probably also to guanine and uracil.           However, such a medium
seemed preferable to a “minimum”            medium which might be unduly sensi-
tive to non-specific stimulatory        substances or inhibitory substances that
might be introduced with the sample.           Doubling of the glucose and sodium
acetate increases acid formation only slightly and has no effect on the assay
values.
    In the development of the method for lysine, standard curves were ob-
tained frequently which “dipped” in the center in contrast to normal linear
curves.     The medium in use at the time was one which had been and still
was entirely satisfactory        for histidine and threonine assays developed
earlier.    Amino acid values from such irregular curves did not agree closely
when calculated from the different assay levels and were high compared to
those from assays with normal standard curves.          The dip was eliminated by
doubling the concentration         of adenine, guanine, uracil, and vitamin sup-
plements, except folic acid. Increase of the purine and pyrimidine bases
was the most important factor in eliminating the dip, followed by biotin and
nicotinic acid. However, the higher concentration           of all three was neces-
sary for linear curves.       The modified basal medium proved to be satisfac-
tory for the assay of histidine and threonine and also for the remainder of the
amino acid assay methods developed subsequently.
    The proposed assay method fulfils, for each of the amino acids, the con-
ventional but adequate criteria of reliability: (a) Essentially the same amino
acid values are obtained for a particular protein irrespective of the amount
of sample assayed, thus indicating that the method is stable to non-specific
stimulatory    or inhibitory substances which may be introduced with samples
 (Table IV).      Thii holds for such complex materials as tankage, blood meal,
and yeast and also for carrots and potatoes which contain only small
amounts of amino acids and must be added, therefore, in relatively large

amounts to the assay medium.      (b) Th e results are readily reproducible, so
that the same values are obtained for a given protein in repeated assays

arginine in the nutrition of certain Neurospora mutants (19) and the chick
 (20) are unable to do so for Streptococcus faecalis.   Likewise, the combina-

acid as is the case with one of the L. arabinosus methods (9). (e) In general,
the microbiological values for purified and impure proteins are in reasonably
good agreement with those obtained by the more recent, improved chemi-
cal methods.     The degree of agreement for lysine is characteristic   of all of
the essential amino acids with the exception of methionine (Table VIII) for
which lower microbiological values were obtained, consistently.       In view of
the remarkable specificity of the microbial response to methionine (Table
VII) and also to the other amino acids, it seems possible that the higher
chemical values may include substances other than methionine.           For fur-
ther comparisons of the microbiological values for the purified proteins and

maximum amino acid values. The data in Table XI are typical.       For some
of the proteins, there is evidence of slight destruction or racemization of
some of the amino acids after 30 hours. The results are in accord with

similar microbiological data of other investigators   (7,8, 10) and emphasize,
unequivocally,   in contrast to conflicting chemical data (36), the marked
stability of the amino acids to acid hydrolysis.    Since periods of hydrolysis
considerably in excess of those required for maximum liberation of amino
acids from proteins cause no apparent. destruction,       the data support the
view that the amino acid values of protein hydrolysates         are the same as
those of the intact proteins.

   * The results are not calculated to 16 per cent nitrogen                                      because of difficulty          in
obtaining concordant nitrogen values.

     For tryptophane  assays with Luctobucillus arabinosus, Ba(OH)z (9) or
enzymatic       digestion
                      of proteins (3) has been recommended.     Although   ir-
regular results have been reported with NaOH digestion (3), it has proved
satisfactory under our conditions. To insure complete liberation and race-
mization of tryptophane, it is necessary to hydrolyze proteins for at least 10
hours (Table XI) and to limit the sample to an amount which doesnot con-
tain more than 10 to 15 mg. of tryptophane.          There is little danger
of exceeding that quantity if not more than 0.5 gm. of impure or 100 mg. of
purified protein is used.

   The described method is eminently suitable for obtaining many analyses
within a short time. One experienced operator can assay six proteins for
all essential amino acids in little more than a week.    The techniques re-
quired are relatively simple although elementary knowledge of bacteriologi-
cal technique is essential in maintaining purity of stock cultures and pre-
venting contamination of assays.

                                                 SUMMARY

    An accurate, specific, and sensitive microbiological method is described
for the determination     of the ten essential amino acids, namely histidine,
arginine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, threonine, trypto-
phane, and phenylalanine, in foodstuffs and other natural products as well
as in purified proteins and synthetic amino acid mixtures.         A complete




                                                                                                                   Downloaded from http://www.jbc.org/ at CAPES/MEC - UFSM on December 15, 2015
amino acid analysis can be made with 1.5 gm. or less of sample. With only
one medium and procedure, nine of the amino acids are determined with
Streptococcus faecalis and phenylalanine with Lactobaeillus delbriiclcii LD5.
The response of the two organisms to the amino acids is measured by
titrating, with standard alkali, the lactic acid formed during growth.     The
method yields many replicate results within a short time and lends itself
readily to routine use. The quantities of essential amino acids in casein,
gelatin, egg albumin, p-lactoglobulin, silk fibroin, tobacco mosaic virus, rye,
wheat, patent flour, soy bean flour, whole milk, peas, carrots, potatoes, beef
liver, brewers’ yeast, blood meal, tankage, alfalfa meal, and linseed meal are
presented.
