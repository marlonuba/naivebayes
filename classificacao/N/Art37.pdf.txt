It has been a long-standing goal in systems biology to find relations between the topological properties and functional
features of protein networks. However, most of the focus in network studies has been on highly connected proteins
(‘‘hubs’’). As a complementary notion, it is possible to define bottlenecks as proteins with a high betweenness
centrality (i.e., network nodes that have many ‘‘shortest paths’’ going through them, analogous to major bridges and
tunnels on a highway map). Bottlenecks are, in fact, key connector proteins with surprising functional and dynamic
properties. In particular, they are more likely to be essential proteins. In fact, in regulatory and other directed
networks, betweenness (i.e., ‘‘bottleneck-ness’’) is a much more significant indicator of essentiality than degree (i.e.,
‘‘hub-ness’’). Furthermore, bottlenecks correspond to the dynamic components of the interaction network—they are
significantly less well coexpressed with their neighbors than nonbottlenecks, implying that expression dynamics is
wired into the network topology.

Author Summary

A network is a graph consisting of a number of nodes with edges
connecting them. Recently, network models have been widely
applied to biological systems. Here, we are mainly interested in two
types of biological networks: the interaction network, where nodes
are proteins and edges connect interacting partners; and the
regulatory network, where nodes are proteins and edges connect
transcription factors and their targets. Betweenness is one of the
most important topological properties of a network. It measures the
number of shortest paths going through a certain node. Therefore,
nodes with the highest betweenness control most of the
information flow in the network, representing the critical points of
the network. We thus call these nodes the ‘‘bottlenecks’’ of the
network. Here, we focus on bottlenecks in protein networks. We find
that, in the regulatory network, where there is a clear concept of
information flow, protein bottlenecks indeed have a much higher
tendency to be essential genes. In this type of network, between-
ness is a good predictor of essentiality. Biological researchers can
therefore use the betweenness as one more feature to choose
potential targets for detailed analysis.



   Moreover, Han et al. found that there are two categories of
protein hubs within the yeast protein-interaction network:
‘‘party hubs’’ interact with most of their partners simulta-
neously, whereas ‘‘date hubs’’ bind theirs asynchronously [21].
Because protein bottlenecks in the interaction network
connect different functional clusters—as mentioned above
in [17]—it is conceivable that bottlenecks with high degrees
should have a higher tendency to be date hubs.                                Figure 1. Schematic Showing a Bottleneck and the Four Categories of
